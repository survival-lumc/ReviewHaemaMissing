N2  - Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) generally have poor overall survival (OS). Interventions that result in improved OS after relapse are not well established. The efficacy of second cellular therapy and specific indications are matters of debate. This study was conducted to evaluate factors associated with postrelapse survival and the efficacy of a second course of cellular therapy. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with AML and MDS who underwent a first allo-HCT between 2010 and 2017 at our center but subsequently relapsed. One hundred and four patients with AML and 44 patients with MDS were included (total n = 148). Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell grafts were either unmodified or T cell-depleted (TCD) by CD34+ selection ex vivo. Forty-five patients (30.4%) received a second cellular therapy after relapse, either a second allo-HCT (n = 28; 18.9%) or donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) (n = 17; 11.5%). The median age at transplantation was 60 years (range, 24 to 78 years). The median time to relapse (TTR) after transplantation was 6.5 months (range, 1 to 60.9 months), and the ensuing median OS was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8 to 8.9 months). In univariable analysis, longer TTR, relapse type (measurable residual disease versus morphologic), relapse occurring in the most recent years, and receipt of cellular therapy after relapse were associated with better outcomes, whereas adverse cytogenetics and/or abnormality of TP53, as well as NPM1 mutation in patients with AML, were associated with adverse outcomes. Relapse type, year of relapse, and a variable resulting from the combination of TTR and receipt of second cellular therapy remained significantly associated with postrelapse survival in multivariable analysis. In a separate multivariable model, adjusted only for TTR, relapse type, and receipt of second cellular therapy, an adverse effect of NPM1 mutation on survival was confirmed. We could not show an effect of post-transplantation maintenance on survival after relapse. In both univariable and multivariable analysis, we found a positive association for second cellular therapy with survival after relapse in patients who relapsed early (<6 months) after allo-HCT and a similar trend in patients who relapsed late (>12 months) after transplantation. Two-year OS after a second cellular therapy was 44.9% (95% CI, 28.5% to 61.4%), and it was significantly better in patients with <5% BM blasts before cell infusion. We could not show different effects on survival after second cellular therapy for DLI versus second allo-HCT in univariable analysis. Survival after relapse is improving over time, but this remains a challenging event, especially for patients who relapse early after transplantation. We found that a second cellular therapy could offer a benefit even in these cases. Nonetheless, more research is needed to clarify the most appropriate treatment choices after relapse. These are probably driven by underlying genetic and immunologic conditions, which should be the focus of future studies.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Background: Carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2; glucarpidase) is a rescue drug for patients at risk for kidney injury from high-dose methotrexate (MTX). As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG2, we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG2 use. Procedure: Cases who received CPDG2 and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m2 between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG2 use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. Result(s): We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG2, 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m2 of MTX received CPDG2. Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG2. Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG2. Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG2 (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG2 use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG2. If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Molecular abnormalities are frequent in core-binding factor (CBF) AMLs, but their prognostic relevance is controversial. Sixty-two patients were retrospectively analyzed and 47 harbored at least one gene mutation with a next-generation-sequencing assay. The most common molecular mutation was KIT mutation (30.6%), followed by NRAS (24.2%) and ASXL1 (14.5%) mutations, which was associated with a higher number of bone marrow blasts (p =.049) and older age (p =.027). The survival analysis showed KIT mutation adversely affected the overall survival (OS) (p =.046). NRAS mutation was associated with inferior OS (p =.016) and RFS (p =.039). Eight patients carried co-mutations of KIT and NRAS and had worse OS (p =.012) and RFS (p =.034). The multivariate analysis showed age >=60 years and additional chromosomal abnormalities were significant adverse factors for OS. Thus, co-mutations of KIT and NRAS were significantly associated with a poor prognosis and should be taken into account when assessing for prognostic stratification in patients with CBF-AML.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - This study evaluated the influence of MTHFR C677T/A1298C polymorphisms on the survival of pediatric NHL. We enrolled 374 patients including 283 males and 91 females between 2014 and 2020. The median age was 9 years. The tumor types included Burkitt lymphoma (n = 180), lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 95), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 64), and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 35). A subgroup of 158 patients were genotyped concerning C677T/A1298C polymorphisms. Neither C677T nor A1298C polymorphism was a significant factor in multivariate analysis. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients carrying 677 T allele had a significantly higher 5-year EFS rate in the whole group (n = 158), and higher 5-year EFS/OS rates in the subgroup of BL/DLBCL than those with wild type. In conclusion, the C677T polymorphism could be used for survival prediction and potential risk stratification for further treatment protocols for Chinese pediatric NHL, especially for BL/DLBCL.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) receptor-ligand mismatch has been shown to be protective for acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD, cGVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute leukemia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered as one of the most promising prophylaxis for severe GVHD. However, there are no prospective or retrospective studies determining whether they can work synergistically on GVHD. To investigate the potential influence of KIR matching and MSCs, and their synergism on aGVHD and cGVHD after allo-HSCT in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Data from 104 patients with AML and 50 patients with ALL treated with allo-HSCT in the transplantation unit were retrospectively analyzed. KIR genotyping was performed by the PCR-SSO method. The amplicons were quantified on the Luminex 200 flow analyzer and analyzed using the Quick-Type for Lifecodes software to generate KIR data. Cox proportional hazards models were used in multivariate analyses. KIR receptor-ligand matching was associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD compared to KIR receptor-ligand mismatching (p < 0.001) in AML patients, but KIR ligand-mismatching had no significant effect on aGVHD or cGVHD in ALL patients. In contrast, MSCs reduced the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD in both AML and ALL patients (AML: p = 0.006; ALL: p = 0.008) regardless of KIR mismatching. The combination of KIR receptor-ligand mismatch and MSC transplantation significantly suppressed grade II-IV aGVHD occurrence in AML patients (p = 0.039). In the KIR mismatch group, the incidence of aGVHD was 2.8% in patients receiving MSC compared to 14.6% in those who did not (p = 0.047). KIR receptor-ligand mismatch, MSC transplantation and their combined use significantly reduced the risk of aGVHD after allo-HSCT. These data provide a clinically applicable strategy to reduce aGVHD, thus improving allo-HSCT outcome.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type (ENKTL) is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and most of the patients presented localized disease. Combined modality therapy (CMT), namely chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, has been recommended for patients with early-stage ENKTL. However, the optimal CMT has not been fully clarified. This study reports the efficacy and toxicity of sequential P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) and radiotherapy in a large Chinese cohort comprising of 202 patients diagnosed with early-stage ENKTL from six medical centers. The observed best overall response rate was 96.0% and 168 (83.2%) patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 44.1 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 74.6% and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis suggested that extensive primary tumor (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] 3.660, 95% CI 1.820-7.359, p < 0.001; OS, HR 3.825, 95% CI 1.442-10.148, p = 0.007) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >= 2 (PFS, 3.042, 95% CI 1.468-6.306, p = 0.003; OS, HR 3.983, 95% CI 1.678-9.457, p = 0.02) were independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes. Among the established prognostic models for ENKTL, the nomogram-revised risk index model had optimal prognostic risk stratification ability (PFS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001) and relatively balanced population distribution. The adverse events of this CMT were well-tolerated and manageable. In conclusion, sequential P-GEMOX and radiotherapy showed favorable efficacy with acceptable toxicity, and could be an effective treatment option for early-stage ENKTL patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Methotrexate (MTX), an antimetabolite for the treatment of leukemia, could cause neutropenia and subsequently fever, which might lead to treatment delay and affect prognosis. Here, we aimed to predict neutropenia and fever related to high-dose MTX using artificial intelligence. This study included 139 pediatric patients newly diagnosed with standard- or intermediate risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Fifty-seven SNPs of 16 genes were genotyped. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to select SNPs and clinical covariates for model developing. Five machine learning algorithms combined with four resampling techniques were used to build optimal predictive model. The combination of random forest with adaptive synthetic appeared to be the best model for neutropenia (sensitivity = 0.935, specificity = 0.920, AUC = 0.927) and performed best for fever (sensitivity = 0.818, specificity = 0.924, AUC = 0.870). By machine learning, we have developed and validated comprehensive models to predict the risk of neutropenia and fever. Such models may be helpful for medical oncologists in quick decision-making.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - In elderly patients (pts) with aggressive B cell lymphoma (aNHL), curative treatment often cannot be administered because of comorbidities and tolerability. We analyzed the influence of age in pts > 60 years receiving the R-CHOP-14 regimen within different prospective DSHNHL trials. Of the RICOVER-60 trial and CHOP-R-ESC trials, 1171 aNHL pts were included in this retrospective analysis of age-dependent event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). All patients received prophylactic G-CSF, and anti-infective prophylaxis with amphotericin B mouth wash and oral fluorchinolone was optional. In the CHOP-R-ESC trials, prophylaxis was augmented to include mandatory continuous orally administered aciclovir and a pneumocystis prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole as well as oral fluorchinolones during neutropenia. The patient population was separated into 4 age groups (61-65 years, 66-70 years, 71-75 years, and 76-80 years). The results from the RICOVER-60 trial were subsequently confirmed in the following CHOP-R-ESC trials by a multivariate analysis adjusted for IPI factors and gender. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in EFS, PFS, and OS were seen between age groups (RICOVER-60). Hematotoxicity, infections, and TRM increased with age. TRM was significantly elevated in the age group 76-80 years. Therefore, this analysis shows that an age above 75 years defines an especially vulnerable patient population when being treated with chemoimmunotherapy for aNHL. Prophylactic anti-infective drugs are essential and clinically effective in reducing morbidity when treating elderly aNHL pts.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - The optimal stem cell (SC) mobilization strategy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) remains a matter of debate. Possible approaches include low or high doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy), other chemotherapeutic agents, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone. The scope of the study was to compare low-dose Cy plus G-CSF versus intermediate-high-dose Cy plus G-CSF versus G-CSF alone for SC mobilization in MM, in terms of efficacy and safety. We retrospectively analyzed 422 MM patients undergoing SC mobilization in 6 Italian centers, including 188 patients who received low-dose Cy (LD-Cy group, defined as 2 g/m2), 163 patients who received intermediate-high-dose Cy (HD-Cy group, defined as >= 3 g/m2), and 71 patients who received G-CSF alone (G-CSF group). The median peak of circulating CD34+ cells was 77/microL in the LD-Cy group, 92/microL in the HD-Cy group, and 55/microL in the G-CSF group (P =.0001). The median amount of SCs collected was 9.1 x 106/kg, 9.7 x 106/kg, and 5.6 x 106/kg in the 3 groups, respectively (P =.0001). The rate of mobilization failure (defined as failure to collect >=2 x 106/kg) was 3.7% in the LD-Cy group, 3.4% in the HD-Cy group, and 4.3% in the G-CSF group (P =.9). The target SC dose of at least 4 x 106/kg was reached in 90.4%, 91.1%, and 78.6% of the patients in these 3 groups, respectively (P =.014). The "on demand" use of plerixafor was higher in the G-CSF group (76%) compared with the LD-Cy group (19%) and the HD-Cy group (6%). In multivariate analysis, G-CSF mobilization and previous use of melphalan or radiotherapy were independently associated with failure to collect the target SC dose of >=4 x 106/kg. No impacts of age, blood counts, or previous treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, or carfilzomib were observed. Our results suggest that LD-Cy may be considered for successful SC mobilization in patients with MM.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - The implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has influenced diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decisions in myeloid malignancies. However, the clinical relevance of serial molecular annotation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing active treatment is unknown. MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patients who had at least two NGS assessments were identified. Outcomes according to mutation clearance (NGS-) on serial assessment were investigated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of NGS trajectory on overall survival (OS). A total of 157 patients (MDS [n = 95]; sAML [n = 52]; CMML [n = 10]) were identified, with 93% of patients receiving treatment between NGS assessments. Magnitude of VAF delta from baseline was significantly associated with quality of response to treatment. Patients achieving NGS- had significantly improved OS compared to patients with mutation persistence (median OS not reached vs. 18.5 months; P = 0.002), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis (HR,0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.56; P = 0.0064). Serial TP53 VAF evaluation predicts outcomes with TP53 clearance representing an independent covariate for superior OS (HR,0.22; 95%CI = 0.05-0.99; P = 0.048). Collectively, our study highlights the clinical value of serial NGS during treatment and warrants prospective validation of NGS negativity as a biomarker for treatment outcome.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) heralds high risk of relapse. Whether preemptive recombinant interleukin-2 (pre-IL2) is effective for patients with late-onset MRD (LMRD) remains unknown. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of pre-IL2 (n = 30) and pre-DLI (n = 25) for LMRD in patients receiving allo-HSCT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The 1-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 86.7% and 78.4% (P = 0.267), 83.3% and 75.6% (P = 0.329), the cumulative incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) at 100 days post-preemptive intervention was 3.3% and 12.0% (P = 0.226) in the pre-IL2 group and pre-DLI group, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 7.7% and 27.9% (P = 0.018), 13.6% and 20.0% (P = 0.561) and 3.3% and 5.5% (P = 0.321) in the two groups, respectively. No remarkable differences in CIR, OS, and DFS between the two intervention groups were found in multivariate analysis. The GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) were better in the pre-IL2 group than in the pre-DLI group (HR = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.76; P = 0.011). In conclusion, preemptive low-dose IL2 and preemptive DLI yield comparable outcomes for patients with LMRD receiving allo-HSCT, in terms of aGVHD, NRM, relapse, OS, and DFS. However, preemptive low-dose IL2 has a lower incidence of moderate/severe cGVHD and a higher CRFS. Preemptive low-dose IL2 may be an alternative method for patients who develop LMRD after allo-HSCT, particularly for patients who cannot receive preemptive DLI.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The ideal conditioning intensity in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is evolving. Previous prospective studies comparing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) versus reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have shown mixed results. In many of these studies, patients were not stratified based on measurable residual disease (MRD). We evaluated the effect of conditioning intensity on the outcomes of AML patients in complete remission (CR) with flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity. A total of 135 patients age 20 to 75 years with AML in CR1 or CR2 and flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity who underwent allogeneic HSCT at our center between 2011 and 2019 were evaluated. We compared overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of MAC (n = 89) and RIC (n = 46). Although the patients receiving RIC were older (62 versus 51 years; P < .0001), there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and European Leukemia Network risk criteria and disease status (CR1 or CR2) at the time of transplantation. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, no statistically significant differences in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 1.42, P = .411) or RFS (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.48 to 2.09, P = .99) were identified. The cumulative incidence of NRM (HR, 0.595; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.48; P = .2644) and relapse (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.23; P = .9872) was not different between the 2 groups. Grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were more frequent in the MAC group (39.3% verses 19.9% [P = .018] and 19.3% versus 2.3% [P < .001], respectively), as was moderate/severe chronic GVHD (23.6% versus 15.8%; P = .038). Our data indicate that conditioning intensity did not appear to affect OS, RFS, NRM, and relapse risk in patients with MRD-negative AML as measured by flow cytometry. RIC resulted in less severe acute and chronic GVHD.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - We assessed the impact of donor type on long-term outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 440 consecutive adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1), particularly focusing on the donor type-specific difference in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). Donor sources were matched sibling donor (MSD; n = 199), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 110), 1-allele-mismatched unrelated donor (1-MMUD; n = 83), and cord blood (CB; n = 48). Cumulative incidence of severe chronic GVHD was 14.8% for MSD-HCT, 30.1% for MUD-HCT, 9.6% for 1-MMUD-HCT, and 4.2% for CBT, respectively (P < 0.001), while no difference was observed in grade III-IV acute GVHD. After a median follow-up of 58.1 months, cumulative incidence of relapse was 26.1% for MSD-HCT, 27.2% for MUD-HCT, 31.2% for 1-MMUD-HCT, and 7.2% for CBT, respectively (P = 0.042). Disease-free survival and overall survival were comparable among all donor sources. However, GRFS for MSD-HCT, MUD-HCT, 1-MMUD-HCT, and CBT was 33.1%, 14.5%, 42.1%, and 50.3%, respectively (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, CBT showed a comparable GRFS to MSD-HCT (HR, 0.78; P = 0.290), while MUD-HCT was associated with a poorer GRFS (HR, 1.53; P = 0.002). Given the encouraging GRFS of CBT, our data suggest that CBT remains a valid option for adult ALL in CR1.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The proteasome inhibitors, carfilzomib and bortezomib, are widely used to treat myeloma but head-to-head comparisons have produced conflicting results. We compared the activity of these proteasome inhibitors in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (KCd vs. VCd) in second-line treatment using fixed duration therapy and evaluated the efficacy of carfilzomib maintenance. MUKfive was a phase II controlled, parallel group trial that randomized patients (2:1) to KCd (n=201) or VCd (n=99); responding patients on carfilzomib were randomized to maintenance carfilzomib (n=69) or no further treatment (n=72). Primary endpoints were: (i) very good partial response (non-inferiority, odds ratio [OR] 0.8) at 24 weeks, and (ii) progression-free survival. More participants achieved a very good partial response or better with carfilzomib than with bortezomib (40.2% vs. 31.9%, OR=1.48, 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 2.31; non-inferior), with a trend for particular benefit in patients with adverse-risk disease. KCd was associated with higher overall response (partial response or better, 84.0% vs. 68.1%, OR=2.72, 90% CI: 1.62, 4.55, P=0.001). Neuropathy (grade >=3 or >=2 with pain) was more common with bortezomib (19.8% vs. 1.5%, P<0.0001), while grade >=3 cardiac events and hypertension were only reported in the KCd arm (3.6% each). The median progression-free survival in the KCd arm was 11.7 months vs. 10.2 months in the VCd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.95, 80% CI: 0.77, 1.18). Carfilzomib maintenance was associated with longer progression-free survival, median 11.9 months vs. 5.6 months for no maintenance (HR 0.59, 80% CI: 0.46-0.77, P=0.0086). When used as fixed duration therapy in first relapase, KCd is at least as effective as VCd, and carfilzomib is an effective maintenance agent.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - The role of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-ligand mismatch (KIR-ligand mismatch) between donors and recipients undergoing cord blood transplantation (CBT) is controversial. If each immunosuppressant differently affects natural killer (NK) cell function, the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch may be altered depending on the type of graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. To verify this hypothesis, the difference in the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch was retrospectively assessed between patients who received CBT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as GVHD prophylaxis comprising tacrolimus plus methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). In the MMF group (n = 1363), KIR-ligand mismatch augmented the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM; hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; P = 0.008), which worsened overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30, P = 0.0077). In the analysis of each KIR-ligand mismatch type, HLA-C2 mismatch had a favorable effect on relapse incidence (HR, 0.56; P = 0.0043) and OS (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) only in the MTX group. In the MMF group, HLA-A3/A11 mismatch worsened NRM (HR, 1.93; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 1.48; P = 0.014). These results imply that the effects of KIR-ligand mismatch differ with the type of GVHD prophylaxis and that assessing the KIR-ligand mismatch status is important for CBT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in cord blood transplantation (CBT) may result in the proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cells. Similarly, a mismatch of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand induces NK cell activation. Therefore, if CMV reactivation occurs in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch, it might improve CBT outcomes. We assessed the difference in the effect of CMV reactivation in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch on disease relapse in the graft-versus-host direction. A total of 2840 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Among those with a HLA-Bw4/A3/A11 (KIR3DL-ligand) mismatch, CMV reactivation up to 100 days following CBT had a favorable impact on relapse (18.9% vs. 32.9%, P = 0.0149). However, this effect was not observed in cases without the KIR3DL-ligand mismatch or in those with or without a HLA-C1/C2 (KIR2DL-ligand) mismatch. The multivariate analysis suggested that CMV reactivation had a favorable effect on relapse only in cases with a KIR3DL-ligand mismatch (hazard ratio 0.54, P = 0.032). Moreover, the interaction effect between CMV reactivation and KIR3DL-ligand mismatch on relapse was significant (P = 0.039). Thus, our study reveals the association between KIR-ligand mismatches and CMV reactivation, which will enhance CBT outcomes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Hispanic children have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inferior treatment outcomes relative to non-Hispanic White children. We previously reported that Hispanic children with ALL had lower risk of fracture and osteonecrosis. To unravel the genetic root of such ethnic differences, we genotyped 449 patients from the DFCI 05-001 cohort and analyzed their ancestry. Patients with discordant clinical and genetic ancestral groups were reclassified, and those with unknown ancestry were reassigned on the basis of genetic estimates. Both clinical and genetic ancestries were analyzed in relation to risk of bone toxicities and survival outcomes. Consistent with clinically reported race/ethnicity, genetically defined Hispanic and Black patients had significantly lower risk of fracture (Hispanic: Subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.81; P = 01; Black: SHR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.75; P =.01), and osteonecrosis (Hispanic: SHR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.93; P =.04; Black: SHR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08-0.78; P =.02). The lower risk was driven by African but not Native American or Asian ancestry. In addition, patients with a higher percentage of Native American ancestry had significantly poorer overall survival and event-free survival. Our study revealed that the lower risk of bone toxicities among Black and Hispanic children treated for ALL was attributed, in part, to the percentage of African ancestry in their genetic admixture. The findings provide suggestive evidence for the protective effects of genetic factors associated with African decent against bone damage caused by ALL treatment and clues for future studies to identify underlying biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Both haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) exhibit strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, the role of prophylactic DLI following haploidentical HSCT remains unclear. Here, 34 patients with high-risk acute leukemia who underwent low-dose anti-T-lymphocyte globulin-Fresenius (ATG-F)-based myeloablative haploidentical HSCT and prophylactic modified DLI (pro-DLI) were well-matched with patients without pro-DLI. The 5-year overall survival (OS) (67.8% versus 41.3%, P < 0.01) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) (64.6% versus 33.9%, P < 0.01) of pro-DLI cohort were superior to the control cohort. A slightly higher GVHD-free/relapse-free survival was found in the pro-DLI cohort (32.8% versus 16.3%, P = 0.32). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of the pro-DLI recipients was significantly lower than that of the control cohort (14.7% versus 49.3%, P = 0.01). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days after pro-DLI was 17.6% and 9.1%, respectively. There was no difference between the two cohorts in terms of the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD and non-relapse mortality. Data from the multivariate analysis demonstrated that pro-DLI was an independent protective variable for LFS (P = 0.01, hazard ratio {HR} = 0.35), OS (P = 0.01, HR = 0.32), and relapse (P = 0.02, HR = 0.33). Taken together, we demonstrate that pro-DLI after ATG-F-based HSCT effectively decreases the risk of relapse and improves long-term survival of patients with high-risk acute leukemia without increasing treatment toxicity.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - In the absence of HLA-matched related and unrelated donors, alternative donors must be found for patients in need of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). There are at least 3 donor options: a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and a haploidentical related donor (haplo); however, the optimal alternative donor type remains to be established. This study aimed to address how the outcomes of patients receiving these 3 alternative donor HCTs differ, and whether these outcomes change over time post-transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed Japanese nationwide transplantation registry data of adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic HCT while in first complete remission (CR) from an MMUD with a 7/8 match at the allele level (n = 601), with UCB (n = 1110), or from a haploidentical related donor (n = 221) between 2007 and 2018. For patients who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2014, the 3-year overall survival (OS) for the MMUD, UCB, and Haplo groups was 60%, 54%, and 47%, respectively (P = .022). For those who underwent transplantation between 2015 and 2018, the 3-year OS in these groups was 60%, 66%, and 63%, respectively (P = .693). Multivariate analysis revealed that the risks of both overall mortality and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were significantly lower in the later period than in the earlier period in the UCB group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [P < .001] for OS; HR, 0.64 [P < .001] for NRM) and the Haplo group (HR, 0.58 [P = .019 for OS; HR, 0.39 [P = .004] for NRM), but not in the MMUD group (HR, 1.07 [P = .631] for OS; HR, 1.26 [P = .175] for NRM). The results of a test for interaction showed a significant difference in the effect of transplantation period on OS and NRM between the MMUD and UCB groups (P = .014 for OS; P = .004 for NRM) and between the MMUD and Haplo groups (P = .034 for OS; P = .003 for NRM). These findings demonstrate the recent improvements in the outcomes of UCB and Haplo transplantations in patients with AML in first CR that have resulted in a similar OS in patients undergoing HCT with grafts from MMUDs, UCB, and haploidentical donors in the later period of the study.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - To evaluate whether outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation differ according to disease type, a three-way comparison for patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 3318), AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (n = 208), and MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB) (n = 994) was performed. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) for de novo AML, AML evolving from MDS, and MDS-EB were 60%, 42%, and 41% (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that, compared to de novo AML, AML evolving from MDS was associated with a higher risk of NRM (p = 0.030) and MDS-EB with a higher risk of relapse (p < 0.001), both leading to lower OS (p = 0.010 and p < 0.001, respectively). These findings demonstrate inter-disease differences in post-transplant outcomes and highlight the needs to reduce NRM for AML evolving from MDS and to reduce relapse for MDS-EB.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - This study aimed to compare the effect of disease status at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) on post-transplant outcomes between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Japanese nationwide registry data for 6901 patients with AML and 2469 patients with ALL were analyzed. In this study, 2850 (41%), 937 (14%), 62 (1%), and 3052 (44%) AML patients and 1751 (71%), 265 (11%), 23 (1%), and 430 (17%) ALL patients underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR1), second CR (CR2), third or subsequent CR (CR3 +), and non-CR, respectively. The probabilities of overall survival at 5 years for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, CR3 + , and non-CR were 58%, 61%, 41%, and 26% for AML patients and 67%, 45%, 20%, and 21% for ALL patients, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that the risks of relapse and overall mortality were similar for AML patients transplanted in CR1 and CR2 (P = 0.672 and P = 0.703), whereas they were higher for ALL patients transplanted in CR2 than for those transplanted in CR1 (P < 0.001 for both). The risks of relapse and overall mortality for those transplanted in CR3 + and non-CR increased in a stepwise manner for both diseases, with the relevance being stronger for ALL than for AML patients. These results suggest a significant difference in the effect of disease status at HCT on post-transplant outcomes in AML and ALL. Further investigation to incorporate measurable residual disease data is warranted.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - This nationwide multicentre retrospective study was performed to analyze clinical features that predict the prognosis of central nervous system invasion in multiple myeloma (CNS-MM, approximately 1% of MM). Overall, of the 77 adult patients with CNS-MM identified between 2005 and 2016, those diagnosed at MM diagnosis (n = 3) had longer overall survival (OS) than those diagnosed at relapse (n = 74; median: 48.5 vs 2.7 months). Therefore, we compared the relapsed MM with CNS-MM in patients with any treatment (n = 60). Multivariate analyses revealed that lenalidomide treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.27, P = 0.003], intrathecal chemotherapy (IT; HR 0.54, P = 0.05), and radiation therapy (RTx; HR 0.33, P < 0.001) for CNS-MM had a positive effect on longer OS. These factors were used to develop a scoring system combining the number of treatments with lenalidomide, IT, and RTx (0, 1, 2, 3). The OS of CNS-MM patients was stratified based on these factors, with a median OS of 1.1, 4.5, and 7.5 months for patients with zero, one, two to three favourable features, respectively (0 vs 1, P = 0.0002; 1 vs 2-3, P = 0.08). Multimodal treatment including lenalidomide in addition to conventional IT and RTx can improve OS.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Cytogenetic abnormalities are a major risk factor for relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We aimed to evaluate the value of the five-group cytogenetic classification according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS) for predicting the outcome after HSCT in pediatric patients with MDS. We retrospectively analyzed the Japanese registration data of 242 pediatric patients with MDS. According to the R-IPSS classification, 112 (45.5%) patients had good, 55 (22.7%) had intermediate, 64 (26.4%) had poor, and 11 (4.6%) had very poor cytogenetics. The 5-year overall survival (5yOS) was 72%, 69%, 59%, and 30% in the good, intermediate, poor, and very poor cytogenetic subgroups (p = 0.026), respectively. The very good, good, and intermediate subgroups were grouped into a "standard" subgroup and reclassified into three subgroups (standard, poor, and very poor). Patients with very poor risk had worse 5yOS (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-4.61; p = 0.04) and a much higher 5yCIR (hazard ratio 2.52, 95% CI 1.05-6.04; p = 0.04) than those of patients in the standard group in the multivariate analysis, indicating that very poor risk cytogenetic characteristics independently predicted worse outcome after HSCT in pediatric patients with MDS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The combined effects of HLA-allele matching at six-loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1) and CD34+ cell dose on clinical outcomes were analyzed in 1,226 adult cases with single-unit unrelated cord blood transplantation. In the six-loci analysis, low HLA-allele matches did not significantly increase the overall mortality compared to higher matches, whereas in the five-loci analysis excluding HLA-DPB1, they caused a higher overall mortality (HR 1.42, p =.002), possibly due to the graft-versus-leukemia effect of HLA-DPB1 mismatches. A lower CD34+ cell dose (<.50 x 105/kg) resulted in higher mortality and lower engraftment; these inferior outcomes were offset by high HLA-allele matches (7-10/10 match), while the inferior outcomes of low HLA-allele matches were improved by increasing the CD34+ cell dose. Consideration of the combined effects of the CD34+ cell dose and HLA matching may expand the options for transplantable units when HLA matching or the CD34+ cell dose is inadequate.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type (ENKTL) is a type of rare and distinct entity of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with poor prognosis. It is important to evaluate the early treatment response accurately to decide further treatment strategy. 18F-FDG PET/CT plays an important role in response evaluation and prognostic prediction in some kinds of lymphomas. However, data available regarding patients with ENKTL are limited. Thus, in this prospective study, we analyzed the prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in ENKTL. Thirty-four patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL were enrolled in this phase 2 study (NCT02825147, July 7, 2016). The patients received pre-, mid-, and end-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Deauville score (DS), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax), and the change in SUVmax (DELTASUVmax) were recorded for response assessment. The median follow-up period was 42.2 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 82.4% and 73.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that Ann Arbor stage (P < 0.002), mid-treatment DS (P = 0.005), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.001), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.004), end-treatment DS (P < 0.001), and end-SUVmax (P = 0.014) were prognostic factors for OS. Ann Arbor stage (P = 0.001), mid-treatment DS (P = 0.008), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.029), mid-SUVmax (P < 0.001), and end-treatment DS (P =0.021) were of prognostic significance for PFS. Multivariate analysis showed that mid-SUVmax (P = 0.042) and DS at the middle (P = 0.050) and end (P = 0.044) of treatment were significant independent predictors of PFS. 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for predicting the prognosis of ENKTL.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become a breakthrough treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, despite the high initial response rate, the majority of adult patients with B-ALL progress after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Data on the natural history, management, and outcome of adult B-ALL progressing after CD19 CAR T cells have not been described in detail. Herein, we report comprehensive data of 38 adult patients with B-ALL who progressed after CD19 CAR T therapy at our institution. The median time to progression after CAR T-cell therapy was 5.5 months. Median survival after post-CAR T progression was 7.5 months. A high disease burden at the time of CAR T-cell infusion was significantly associated with risk of post-CAR T progression. Thirty patients (79%) received salvage treatment of post-CAR T disease progression, and 13 patients (43%) achieved complete remission (CR), but remission duration was short. Notably, 7 (58.3%) of 12 patients achieved CR after blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab administered following post-CAR T failure. Multivariate analysis revealed that a longer remission duration from CAR T cells was associated with superior survival after progression following CAR T-cell therapy. In summary, overall prognosis of adult B-ALL patients progressing after CD19 CAR T cells was poor, although a subset of patients achieved sustained remissions to salvage treatments, including blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and reinfusion of CAR T cells. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to reduce risk of progression after CAR T-cell therapy and improve outcomes of these patients.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are in the majority of cases characterized by anemia. Both anemia and MDS per se may directly contribute to impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this study, we aimed to investigate the anemia-independent impact of MDS on HRQoL. We evaluated participants (>= 50 years) from the large population-based Lifelines cohort (N = 44,694, mean age 59.0 +/- 7.4 years, 43.6% male) and the European MDS Registry (EUMDS) (N = 1538, mean age 73.4 +/- 9.0 years, 63.0% male), which comprises a cohort of lower-risk MDS patients. To enable comparison concerning HRQoL, SF-36 scores measured in Lifelines were converted to EQ-5D-3L index (range 0-1) and dimension scores. Lower-risk MDS patients had significantly lower HRQoL than those from the Lifelines cohort, as illustrated in both the index score and in the five different dimensions. Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that MDS had an adjusted total impact on the EQ-5D index score (B = - 0.12, p < 0.001) and an anemia-independent "direct" impact (B = - 0.10, p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an anemia-independent impact of MDS in the dimension mobility, self-care, usual activities, and anxiety/depression (all except pain/discomfort). This study demonstrates that the major part of the negative impact of lower-risk MDS on HRQoL is not mediated via anemia. Thus, the therapeutic focus should include treatment strategies directed at underlying pathogenic mechanisms to improve HRQoL, rather than aiming predominantly at increasing hemoglobin levels.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

Here, we studied the infectious complications in 88 patients treated with CD28-based CD19 CAR T-cells. Overall, 36 infections were documented in 24 patients within the first month after CAR T-cell infusion: Six events of bacteremia, sixteen focal bacterial infections, and fourteen systemic or localized viral infections. Seven patients had nine infectious episodes beyond the first 30 days of follow-up, including three events of bacteremia, three focal bacterial, two viral and one fungal infection. The presence of neutropenia, neutropenic fever and lack of response to treatment were associated with a higher rate of infections. Children had less severe infections than adults. In a multivariate analysis lack of response to treatment was the only significant risk factor. Overall, the incidence of bacterial infections following CAR T-cells is modest especially in children and in patients responding to therapy.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Sarcopenia, defined as loss of muscle mass, can occur with aging. We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of muscle quality in multiple myeloma (MM), a hematologic cancer of older adults, undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT). Healthy muscle was quantified by measuring the percent of high-density muscle within the L3 psoas muscle using a novel computed tomography method in 142 eligible patients. Early post-transplant complications were assessed in the first 100 days after transplant. Sarcopenia, defined as <=80% high-density muscle, was found in 72 (51%) patients. Sarcopenic obesity, defined as sarcopenia and a BMI >= 30, was found in 32 (23%) patients. One or more early complications occurred in 22 (16%) patients. Cardiovascular events accounted for 36% of all complications. Patients with sarcopenia had more cardiac complications (12.5%) than patients without (2.9%, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis revealed increased BMI at transplant, but not sarcopenia, was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.22, p = 0.02). Our analysis suggests that sarcopenia is prevalent in MM and associated with increased early post-transplant cardiovascular complications in MM. Obesity, regardless of sarcopenia, is associated with worse survival in MM. Our study generates hypothesis-generating data to risk-stratify patients being considered for autoHCT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) mutations in Myeloid Neoplams (MNs) exhibit DNA hypermethylation via 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) over-production. Clinical impact of azacitidine (AZA) remains inconsistent in IDH1/2-mutated MNs and the potential of serum 2HG as a suitable marker of response to AZA is unknown. To address these questions, we retrospectively analyzed 93 MNs patients (78 AML, 11 MDS, 4 CMML) with IDH1/2 mutations treated with AZA. After a median of 5 cycles of AZA, overall response rate was 28% (including 15% complete remission) and median OS was 12.3 months (significantly shorter in AML compared to MDS/CMML patients). In multivariate analysis of AML patients, DNMT3A mutation was associated with shorter OS while IDH1/2 mutation subtypes had no independent impact. No difference was observed in serum 2HG levels upon AZA treatment between responding and refractory patients suggesting that serum 2HG cannot be used as a surrogate marker of AZA response.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - There are conflicting reports in the literature suggesting that one gender or the other has a better survival with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The present study was done in an attempt to resolve the issue. The effect of gender was examined on 3546 newly diagnosed patients with AML, including 548 patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) enrolled in 10 multi-institutional treatment studies from March 1984 to November 2008. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to estimate event-time distributions for survival and multivariate models were used to examine the gender effect after adjusting for multiple risk factors. P values were based on two-sided tests. Non-APL female patients had a significantly better overall (OS) but not disease-free survival (DFS) than males, irrespective of age, initial white blood cell count, or dose of daunorubicin. No differences were observed for obese or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive patients. Female patients with APL had a significantly better OS and DFS than male patients with APL, and differences in survival were greater for patients with t(15;17) + other cytogenetic abnormalities compared with those with t(15;17) only. Gender is an independent prognostic variable in patients with AML. Whether these survival differences are due to hormonal, genetic or pharmacokinetic differences between the sexes or differential toxin exposure such as smoking is unknown. However, the former seems less likely as patient age did not influence the survival advantage for female patients.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

We compared overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) for patients receiving post-remission therapy on CALGB 10403 to a cohort undergoing myeloablative (MA) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in CR1. In univariate analysis, OS was superior with chemotherapy compared to MA allogeneic HCT (3-year OS 77% vs. 53%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, allogeneic HCT showed inferior OS (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.5-2.66, P < 0.001), inferior DFS (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25-2.12, P < 0.001), and increased NRM (HR 5.41, 95% CI 3.23-9.06, P < 0.001) compared to chemotherapy. A higher 5-year relapse incidence was seen with chemotherapy compared to allogeneic HCT (34% vs. 23%, P = 0.011). Obesity was independently associated with inferior OS (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.63-2.89, P < 0.001), inferior DFS (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.51-2.57, P < 0.001), increased relapse (1.84, 95% CI 1.31-2.59, P < 0.001), and increased NRM (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.37-3.23, P < 0.001). For AYA ALL patients in CR1, post-remission therapy with pediatric-style chemotherapy is superior to MA allogeneic HCT for OS, DFS, and NRM.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The differences in overall morbidity by induction treatment regimen for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. We examined a cohort of children with ALL who received induction chemotherapy between January 2010 and May 2018. We evaluated 20 clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) and readmission and ICU admission rates. Outcomes were compared between standard 3- and 4-drug treatment regimens in multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard ratios. Among 486 eligible patients, the risks of sepsis (HR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.11-4.19), hypoxia (HR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.03-4.18), hyperbilirubinemia (HR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.07-5.74), hyperglycemia (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.29-5.42), thromboembolic event (HR = 4.50, 95% CI = 1.30-15.6), and hyponatremia (HR = 7.88, 95% CI = 1.26-49.4) were significantly higher during 4-drug induction. Despite no differences in readmission or ICU admission rates, 4-drug induction patients had greater total inpatient days (12 vs. 4 days; p<.0001). In conclusion, pediatric patients receiving 4-drug induction for ALL experience higher morbidity. These results inform care practices and patient guidance during induction therapy.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive disease in which survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) remains relatively poor. An assessment of prognostic factors is an important part of treatment decision making and has the potential to be greatly improved by the inclusion of molecular genetics. However, there is a significant knowledge gap in the interpretation of mutational patterns. This study aimed to describe outcomes of allogeneic HCT in patients with CMML in relation to clinical and molecular genetic risk factors. This retrospective study included 64 patients with CMML who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2018, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Next-generation sequencing using targeted myeloid panels was carried out on saved material from 51 patients from the time of transplantation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for analysis of overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence with competing risks and Fine and Gray models were used for analysis of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Mutations were detected in 48 patients (94%), indicating high levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity at transplantation, even among those in complete remission (CR) (n = 14), 86% of whom had detectable mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were ASXL1 (37%), TET2 (37%), RUNX1 (33%), SRSF2 (26%), and NRAS (20%). Risk stratification using the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System molecular score (CPSS-Mol) resulted in 45% of patients moving to a higher risk-group compared with risk stratification using the CPSS. High leucocyte count (>=13 x 109/L), transfusion requirement, and previous intensive chemotherapy were associated with higher incidence of relapse. Being in CR was not linked to better outcomes. Neither ASXL1 nor RUNX1 mutation was associated with a difference in OS, relapse, or NRM, despite being high risk in the nontransplantation setting. TET2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher 3-year OS (73% versus 40%; P = .039). Achieving MRD-negative CR was rare in this CMML cohort, which may explain why we did not observe better outcomes for those in CR. This merits further investigation. Our analyses suggest that the negative impact of ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations can be overcome by allogeneic HCT; however, risk stratification is complex in CMML and requires larger cohorts and multivariate models, presenting an ongoing challenge in this rare disease.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1) mutations are one of the most common molecular biological abnormalities in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and the effect of these mutations on prognosis remains controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic value and clinical characteristics of ASXL1 mutations in PMF patients. Eligible studies were systematically searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. We extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS), the number of patients transformed to acute leukemia, and clinical characteristics to carry out a meta-analysis by fixed effect model or random effect model according to the heterogeneity between studies. A total of 4501 PMF patients from 16 cohorts of 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that ASXL1 mutations might predict a shorter OS (HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.79-2.94, P < 0.00001) and a higher probability of transformation to acute leukemia (LFS: HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.30-2.42, P = 0.0003; the rate of acute leukemia transformation: OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.50-2.83, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, ASXL1 mutations were correlated with patients older than 65 years old, male, a lower level of platelet counts, and a higher risk of the international prognostic score system. These findings indicate that ASXL1 mutations have a significant adverse impact on the prognosis of PMF patients and may contribute to risk stratification and prognostic assessment for PMF patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Aside from cell intrinsic factors such as genetic alterations, immune dysregulation in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a role in the development and progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, the prognostic implications of various immune cells in patients with MDS remain unclear. We adopted CIBERSORTx to estimate the relative fractions of 22 subtypes of immune cells in the BM of 316 patients with MDS and correlated the results with clinical outcomes. A lower fraction of unpolarized M0 macrophages and higher fractions of M2 macrophages and eosinophils were significantly associated with inferior survival. An immune cell scoring system (ICSS) was constructed based on the proportion of these 3 immune cells in the BM. The ICSS high-risk patients had higher BM blast counts, higher frequencies of poor-risk cytogenetics, and more NPM1, TP53, and WT1 mutations than intermediate- and low-risk patients. The ICSS could stratify patients with MDS into 3 risk groups with distinct leukemia-free survival and overall survival among the total cohort and in the subgroups of patients with lower and higher disease risk based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The prognostic significance of ICSS was also validated in another independent cohort. Multivariable analysis revealed that ICSS independently predicted prognosis, regardless of age, IPSS-R, and mutation status. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between high-risk ICSS and nuclear factor kB signaling, oxidative stress, and leukemic stem cell signature pathways. Further studies investigating the mechanistic insight into the crosstalk between stem cells and immune cells are warranted.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Expression of long non-coding RNA KIAA0125 has been incorporated in various gene expression signatures for prognostic prediction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, yet its functions and clinical significance remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biological characteristics of AML bearing different levels of KIAA0125. We profiled KIAA0125 expression levels in bone marrow cells from 347 de novo AML patients and found higher KIAA0125 expression was closely associated with RUNX1 mutation, but inversely correlated with t(8;21) and t(15;17) karyotypes. Among the 227 patients who received standard chemotherapy, those with higher KIAA0125 expression had a lower complete remission rate, shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with lower expression. The prognostic significance was validated in both TCGA and GSE12417 cohorts. Subgroup analyses showed that higher KIAA0125 expression also predicted shorter DFS and OS in patients with normal karyotype or non-M3 AML. In multivariable analysis, higher KIAA0125 expression remained an adverse risk factor independent of age, WBC counts, karyotypes, and mutation patterns. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that higher KIAA0125 expression was associated with hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell signatures and ATP-binding cassette transporters, two predisposing factors for chemoresistance.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Autologous stem cell transplantation as a frontline treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) requires an adequate peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection before processing. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a common regimen for PBSC mobilization; their benefits and risks are controversial. To compare the efficiency, safety, and survival outcomes between the two regimens, we conducted a meta-analysis including 18 studies with 4 prospective and 14 retrospective studies; a total of 2770 patients with MM were analyzed. The CTX plus G-CSF regimen had higher yields of total CD34+ cells (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI (0.30, 0.49)), and higher mobilization rates of the target  2 x 106/kg (OR = 3.34, 95% CI (1.82, 6.11)) and 4 x 106/kg (OR = 2.16, 95% CI (1.69, 2.76)) cells. A favorable event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 0.73, 95% CI (0.58, 0.93), p = 0.01) and better 3-year EFS rate (OR = 1.65, 95% CI (1.1, 2.47), p = 0.02) were also reached in the patients with CTX plus G-CSF mobilization, although the risks of admission (OR = 26.49, 95% CI (7.31, 95.97)) and fever (OR = 13.66, 95% CI (6.21, 30.03)) during mobilization were increased, the treatment-related mortality was consistent (p = 0.26). The CTX plus G-CSF regimen was superior to the G-CSF-alone regimen for PBSC mobilization in patients with MM.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - It is unknown if daratumumab could affect venous thromboembolism (VTE) risks in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, individual participant data from three trials comparing daratumumab (DARA) and non-DARA regimens, the CASTOR, PULLOX and MAIA trial, were pooled into two groups. A total of 896 and 899 patients received DARA and non-DARA regimens, respectively. After a median follow-up of 13.9 and 13.5 months, there was no significant difference in VTE incidence between the two groups (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.57-1.13, p = 0.17). The two groups shared similar VTE risk factors. The SAVED score and IMPEDE-VTE score are two validated VTE risk-stratification tools in MM. In the DARA group, the SAVED score had better performance than the IMPEDE-VTE score in identifying high risk patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The identification of genetic risk subgroups of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) may provide evidence for risk stratification and individualized treatment. We investigated the characteristics and prognostic value of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A deletions in 101 patients with T-ALL. The CDKN2A deletion was present in 23% (23/101) of T-ALL by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The most common type of CDKN2A deletion was homozygous deletion (70%, 16/23). A lower frequency of CDKN2A deletion was found in patients with early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL than in patients with non-ETP-ALL (10.4% vs 34.0%; P =.008). Deletion of CDKN2A was significantly associated with younger age (P =.001), higher white blood cell (WBC) count (P <.001) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P =.002). Patients with CDKN2A deletion had lower 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates than patients without CDKN2A deletion (2-year OS: 18.6% +/- 8.9% vs 47.4% +/- 6.2%, P =.032; EFS: 16.4 +/- 8.3 vs 38.6 +/- 5.9%, P =.022). In multivariable analysis, CDKN2A deletion was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (P =.016). In conclusion, adult T-ALL patients with CDKN2A deletion had a poor prognosis, and these patients might benefit from intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Minimal residual disease (MRD) is an important independent prognostic factor for relapse and survival in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Compared with adult B-cell ALL, reports of adult T-cell ALL (T-ALL) MRD have been scarce and mostly based on molecular methods. We evaluated the prognostic value of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM)-based MRD at the end of induction (EOI-MRD). The present retrospective study included 94 adult patients with T-ALL. MRD was detected by six- to eight-colour FCM. Patients who were EOI-MRD positive had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (87.6% vs. 38.8%, P = 0.0020), and a lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (5.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.0005) and overall survival (OS) (32.7% vs. 69.7%, P < 0.0001) than those who were EOI-MRD negative. Moreover, for patients who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at their first remission, EOI-MRD positivity was predictive of post-transplant relapse (2-year CIR: 68.2% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis showed that EOI-MRD was an independent prognostic factor for CIR [hazard ratio (HR) 2.139, P = 0.046], RFS (HR 2.125, P = 0.048) and OS (HR 2.987, P = 0.017). In conclusion, EOI-MRD based on FCM was an independent prognostic factor for relapse and survival in adult T-ALL. For patients who underwent HSCT, EOI-MRD could be used to identify patients with a high risk of relapse after allo-HSCT.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Despite the clinical value of HMGB1 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the impact of HMGB1 protein expression on survival of patients with mature T-cell and NK-cell lymphoma (T/NK-CL) is unknown. Here, we evaluated correlations of HMGB1 expression in tumor tissues with pathophysiological characteristics of disease and determined the prognostic value of HMGB1 expression in relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL. HMGB1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 66 cases of relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL, and specimens were classified as high or low HMGB1 expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). High HMGB1 expression was significantly correlated with increased Ki67 levels and progressive lymphoma subtypes. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that high HMGB1 expression was associated with unfavorable PFS (P = 0.006) and poorer OS (P < 0.001). Prognostic factors identified by univariate analysis were prognostic index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma non-specified (PIT) score >= 2, bone marrow involvement, Ki67 >= 70%, and high HMGB1 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high HMGB1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poorer PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 3.593; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.171-11.027; P = 0.025] and OS [HR 7.663; 95% CI 2.367-24.803; P = 0.001]. A proposal prognostic model combining HMGB1 and Ki67 expression showed improved prognostic capacity and may help guide treatment planning. High HMGB1 expression may be a promising prognostic predictor and a potential therapeutic target for relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL. Furthermore, to apply HMGB1 as one of the best bio-maker, an external independent control cohort is needed.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Although;80% of adult patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) achieve a complete remission (CR), more than half of them relapse. Better identification of patients who are likely to relapse can help to inform clinical decisions. We performed RNA sequencing on pretreatment samples from 268 adults with de novo CN-AML who were younger than 60 years of age and achieved a CR after induction treatment with standard "713" chemotherapy. After filtering for genes whose expressions were associated with gene mutations known to impact outcome (ie, CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD]), we identified a 10-gene signature that was strongly predictive of patient relapse (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC], 0.81). The signature consisted of 7 coding genes (GAS6, PSD3, PLCB4, DEXI, JMY, NRP1, C10orf55) and 3 long noncoding RNAs. In multivariable analysis, the 10-gene signature was strongly associated with relapse (P,.001), after adjustment for the FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, and NPM1 mutational status. Validation of the expression signature in an independent patient set from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed the signature's strong predictive value, with AUC 5 0.78. Implementation of the 10-gene signature into clinical prognostic stratification could be useful for identifying patients who are likely to relapse.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia with runt-related transcription factor 1 gene mutation (RUNX1+ AML) is associated with inferior response rates and outcome after conventional chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective, registry-based analysis to elucidate the prognostic value of RUNX1 mutation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). All consecutive adults undergoing alloSCT for AML in first complete remission (CR1) between 2013 and 2019 with complete information on conventional cytogenetics and RUNX1 mutational status were included. Endpoints of interest were cumulative relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, overall and leukemia-free survival (OS/LFS), and GvHD-free/relapse-free survival. A total of 674 patients (183 RUNX1+, 491 RUNX1-) were identified, with >85% presenting as de novo AML. Median follow-up was 16.4 (RUNX1+) and 21.9 (RUNX1-) months. Survival rates showed no difference between RUNX1+ and RUNX1- patients either in univariate or multivariate analysis (2-year OS: 67.7 vs. 66.1%, p = 0.7; 2-year LFS: 61.1 vs. 60.8%, p = 0.62). Multivariate analysis identified age, donor type and poor cytogenetics as risk factors for inferior outcome. Among patients with RUNX+ AML, older age, reduced intensity conditioning and minimal residual disease at alloSCT predicted inferior outcome. Our data provide evidence that the negative influence of RUNX1 mutations in patients with AML can be overcome by transplantation in CR1.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The Mayo-2018 smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) risk score is used routinely in the clinical setting but has only been validated at diagnosis. In SMM patients, the progression risk decreases over time. However, the utility of applying risk stratification models after diagnosis is unknown. We retrospectively studied 704 SMM patients and applied the Mayo 2018 and IMWG-2020 risk stratification models at annual landmark timepoints up to 5 years post diagnosis. The Mayo-2018 and IMWG-2020 models reliably stratified patients based on progression risk when applied post diagnosis. The respective 2-year progression risk in Mayo-2018 high risk patients versus IMWG-2020 intermediate-high risk patients was 51% versus 62% at the 1-year landmark and 47% versus 45% at the 4-year landmark. We showed that patients categorized at Mayo-2018 high-risk at follow-up had a similar risk of progression if the baseline risk assessment was low-intermediate versus high-risk (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.46-2.36, p = 0.931 at 5-year landmark). Patients migrating to a higher risk category during follow up had a higher progression risk compared to patients with stable/decreased risk categorization. Our findings support the use of these risk scores post-diagnosis and suggest that patients evolving to a high-risk category may benefit from early intervention therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Soluble BCMA (sBCMA) levels are elevated in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). However, the association between sBCMA levels and prognosis in MGUS and SMM has not been studied. We retrospectively analyzed sBCMA levels in stored samples from 99 MGUS and 184 SMM patients. Baseline sBCMA levels were significantly higher in MGUS and SMM patients progressing to MM during clinical follow up. When stratified according to the median baseline sBCMA level for each cohort, higher levels were associated with a shorter PFS for MGUS (HR 3.44 comparing sBCMA >=77 vs <77 ng/mL [95% CI 2.07-5.73, p < 0.001] and SMM (HR 2.0 comparing sBCMA >=128 vs <128 ng/mL, 95% 1.45-2.76, p < 0.001) patients. The effect of sBCMA on PFS was similar even after adjusting for the baseline MGUS or SMM risk stratification. We evaluated paired serum samples and found that sBCMA increased significantly in MGUS and SMM patients who eventually progressed to MM, whereas among MGUS non-progressors the sBCMA level remained stable. While our results require independent validation, they suggest that sBCMA may be a useful biomarker to identify MGUS and SMM patients at increased risk of progression to MM independent of the established risk models.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The impact of conditioning regimen prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in pediatric AML-patients is not well studied. We retrospectively analyzed the impact of Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide (BuCy), Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide-Melphalan (BuCyMel) and Clofarabine-Fludarabine-Busulfan (CloFluBu) in pediatric AML-patients, with similar upfront leukemia treatment (NOPHO-DBHconsortium), receiving an HCT between 2010 and 2015. Outcomes of interest were LFS, relapse, TRM and GvHD. 103 patients were included; 30 received BuCy, 37 BuCyMel, and 36 CloFluBu. The 5-years LFS was 43.3% (SE +/- 9.0) in the BuCy group, 59.2 % (SE +/- 8.1) after BuCyMel, and 66.7 % (SE +/- 7.9) after CloFluBu. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed a trend to lower LFS after BuCy compared to CloFluBu (p = 0.07). BuCy was associated with a higher relapse incidence compared to the other regimens (p = 0.06). Younger age was a predictor for relapse (p = 0.02). A strong correlation between Busulfan Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and lower incidence of aGvHD (p < 0.001) was found. In conclusion, LFS after BuCyMel and CloFluBu was comparable, lower LFS was found after BuCy, due to higher relapse incidence. CloFluBu was associated with lower incidence of aGvHD, suggesting lower toxicity with this type of conditioning. This finding is also explained by the impact of Busulfan monitoring.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect-treatment comparison can estimate the treatment effect of tisagenlecleucel in comparison with blinatumomab on rates of complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed or primary refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patient-level data from two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n 5 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n 5 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score. Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68% to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32). These findings support the growing body of clinical trials and real-world evidence demonstrating that tisagenlecleucel is an important treatment option for children and young adults with R/R ALL.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - There is a paucity of data regarding racial disparities in the survival of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL) in the contemporary time-period. Hence, we sought to determine whether racial disparities exist in the survival of patients with iNHLs in the US. We included 68 059 adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL, n = 41 943), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, n = 22 485), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM, n = 3631) who were diagnosed in the US between 2000 and 2017. Race was categorized as White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native (API/AI). The primary outcome was relative survival (RS), which was estimated using flexible parametric survival models. The RS estimates varied according to race and disease histology but were consistently lower for racial minorities, including those diagnosed during the most recent 5-year time-period of 2012-2017. On multivariable analysis for RS, Black patients with FL had a 32% higher excess mortality rate compared to White patients [adjusted excess hazard ratio (aEHR), 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51; p <.001], corresponding to a difference of 55 (95% CI, 24-86) excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. For MZL, Black patients had a 40% higher excess mortality rate compared to White patients (aEHR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.66; p <.001), corresponding to a difference of 62 (95% CI, 26-98) excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. No significant racial differences were detected for patients with WM. The greatest disparity was seen for younger Black patients with FL. Our findings highlight the need for interventions to improve the outcomes of Black patients with iNHLs, particularly younger Black patients with FL.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Patients with hematological malignancies (HM) often require ICU admission, and acute respiratory or renal failure are then independent risk factors for mortality. Data are scarce on acute liver dysfunction (ALD), despite HM patients cumulating risk factors. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the prevalence of ALD in critically ill HM patients and its impact on outcome. Data of all patients with HM admitted to the medical ICU between 2008 and 2018 were extracted from electronic medical records. ALD was defined by ALT > 165 U/L, AST > 230 U/L, or total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze hospital mortality. Charts of survivors with ALD were reviewed to assess impact of ALD on subsequent anti-cancer treatment. We included 971 patients (60% male), age 64 (54-72) years, of whom 196 (20%) developed ALD. ALD patients were younger, more frequently had liver cirrhosis or acute leukemia, and had increased severity of illness and vital organ support needs. ALD was associated with hospital mortality in univariate (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.95-5.80, p < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.24, p = 0.03). Hospital mortality was 46% in ALD patients; among 106 survivors, a third of patients requiring therapy received it as previously planned, and half of the patients were alive at 1 year. In summary, in a large population of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies, 20% developed ALD, which was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality and occasionally altered further anti-cancer treatment.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: The introduction of immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, and autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has improved outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma, but patients with high-risk multiple myeloma have a poor long-term prognosis. We aimed to address optimal treatment for these patients. Method(s): SWOG-1211 is a randomised phase 2 trial comparing eight cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg orally on days 1-14 every 21 days), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days), and dexamethasone (20 mg orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 every 21 days; RVd) induction followed by dose-attenuated RVd maintenance (bortezomib 1 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 15 mg orally on days 1-21; dexamethasone 12 mg orally on days 1, 18, and 15 every 28 days) until disease progression with or without elotuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 for cycles 1-2, on days 1 and 11 for cycles 3-8, and on days 1 and 15 during maintenance). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either RVd or RVd-elotuzumab. High-risk multiple myeloma was defined by one of the following: gene expression profiling high risk (GEPhi), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p) or amp1q21, primary plasma cell leukaemia and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (two times the upper limit of normal or more). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, and all analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis among eligible patients who were evaluable for response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01668719. Finding(s): 100 (RVd n=52, RVd-elotuzumab n=48) patients were enrolled between Oct 27, 2013, and May 15, 2016, across 26 cooperative group institutions in the USA. Median age was 64 years (IQR 57-70, range 36-85). 74 (75%) of 99 had International Staging System stage II or stage III disease, 47 (47%) of 99 had amp1q21, 37 (37%) of 100 had del17p, 11 (11%) of 100 had t(14;16), eight (9%) of 90 were GEPhi, seven (7%) of 100 had primary plasma cell leukaemia, five (5%) of 100 had t(14;20), four (4%) of 100 had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and 17 (17%) had two or more features. With a median follow-up of 53 months (IQR 46-59), no difference in median progression-free survival was observed (RVd 33.64 months [95% CI 19.55-not reached], RVd-elotuzumab 31.47 months [18.56-53.98]; hazard ratio 0.968 [80% CI 0.697-1.344]; one-sided p=0.45]. 37 (71%) of 52 patients in the RVd group and 37 (77%) of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group had grade 3 or worse adverse events. No significant differences in the safety profile were observed, although some notable results included grade 3-5 infections (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, eight [17%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), sensory neuropathy (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, six [13%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), and motor neuropathy (one [2%] of 52 in the RVd group, four [8%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group). There were no treatment-related deaths in the RVd group and one death in the RVd-elotuzumab group for which study treatment was listed as possibly contributing by the investigator. Interpretation(s): In the first randomised study of high-risk multiple myeloma reported to date, the addition of elotuzumab to RVd induction and maintenance did not improve patient outcomes. However, progression-free survival in both study groups exceeded the original statistical assumptions and supports the role for continuous proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drug combination maintenance therapy for this patient population.

N2  - The prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) measured by fusion-gene transcript (FGT) detection was investigated in 76 infants (aged <=1 year) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) rearrangements. Either at the end of induction or at later time-points, FGT-MRD-positivity was associated with poor outcome. FGT-MRD-positivity after first consolidation or first high-risk block detected 46.5% of infants with extremely poor outcome [disease-free survival (SE) 0.06 (0.06), cumulative incidence of relapse (SE) 0.91 (0.05)], which was also confirmed in multivariable analysis. Thus, FGT-MRD measurement at a single time-point clearly identifies infants with ALL who are curable with conventional chemotherapy and those who would benefit only from other treatment approaches.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring after induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the optimal time point for the test remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of NGS MRD at 2 different time points. We performed targeted NGS of 54 genes in bone marrow cells serially obtained at diagnosis, first complete remission (first time point), and after the first consolidation chemotherapy (second time point) from 335 de novo AML patients. Excluding DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations, which are commonly present in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, MRD could be detected in 46.4% of patients at the first time point (MRD1st), and 28.9% at the second time point (MRD2nd). The patients with detectable NGS MRD at either time point had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse and shorter relapse-free survival and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, MRD1st and MRD2nd were both independent poor prognostic factors. However, the patients with positive MRD1st but negative MRD2nd had a similar good prognosis as those with negative MRD at both time points. The incorporation of multiparameter flow cytometry and NGS MRD revealed that the presence of NGS MRD predicted poorer prognosis among the patients without detectable MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry at the second time point but not the first time point. In conclusion, the presence of NGS MRD, especially after the first consolidation therapy, can help predict the clinical outcome of AML patients.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains a potentially curative and useful strategy in high-risk relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at 12 months (M12) post-HSCT is predictive of relapse. This phase II study aimed to achieve M12 MRD negativity (MRDneg) using an MRD-driven immune-intervention (Md-PII) algorithm based on serial flow-cytometry blood MRD, involving cyclosporine tapering followed in case of failure by donor lymphocytes infusions. Patients had high-risk CLL according to the 2006 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation consensus, in complete or partial response with lymphadenopathy <5 cm and comorbidity score <=2. Donors were HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated (10/10). Forty-two enrolled patients with either 17p deletion (front-line, n=11; relapse n=16) or other high-risk relapse (n=15) received reduced intensity-conditioning regimen before HSCT and were submitted to Md-PII. M12-MRDneg status was achieved in 27 of 42 patients (64%) versus 6 of 42 (14.2%) before HSCT. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 19-53), 3-year overall survival, non-relapse mortality and cumulative incidence of relapse are 86.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 70.8-94.4), 9.5% (95% CI: 3.7-23.4) and 29.6% (95% CI: 17.3-47.7). Incidence of 2-year limited and extensive chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is 38% (95% CI: 23-53) and 23% (95% CI: 10-36) including two cases post Md-PII. Fifteen patients converted to MRDneg either after cyclosporine A withdrawal (n=12) or after cGvHD (n=3). As a time-dependent variable, MRDneg achievement at any time-point correlates with reduced relapse (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.14 [range, 0.04-0.53], P=0.004) and improvement of both progression free (HR 0.18 [range, 0.06-0.6], P<0.005) and overall (HR 0.18 [range, 0.03-0.98], P=0.047) survival. These data highlight the value of MRD-driven immune-intervention to induce prompt MRD clearance in the therapy of CLL (clinicaltrials gov.

N2  - Somatic mutations in splicing factor genes frequently occur in myeloid neoplasms. While SF3B1 mutations are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, SRSF2P95 mutations are found in different disease categories, including MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify molecular determinants of this phenotypic heterogeneity, we explored molecular and clinical features of a prospective cohort of 279 SRSF2P95-mutated cases selected from a population of 2663 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Median number of somatic mutations per subject was 3. Multivariate regression analysis showed associations between co-mutated genes and clinical phenotype, including JAK2 or MPL with myelofibrosis (OR = 26.9); TET2 with monocytosis (OR = 5.2); RAS-pathway genes with leukocytosis (OR = 5.1); and STAG2, RUNX1, or IDH1/2 with blast phenotype (MDS or AML) (OR = 3.4, 1.9, and 2.1, respectively). Within patients with SRSF2-JAK2 co-mutation, JAK2 dominance was invariably associated with clinical feature of MPN, whereas SRSF2 mutation was dominant in MDS/MPN. Within patients with SRSF2-TET2 co-mutation, clinical expressivity of monocytosis was positively associated with co-mutated clone size. This study provides evidence that co-mutation pattern, clone size, and hierarchy concur to determine clinical phenotype, tracing relevant genotype-phenotype associations across disease entities and giving insight on unaccountable clinical heterogeneity within current WHO classification categories.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Children receiving intensive chemotherapy for leukemia or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for solid tumors or leukemia are at risk for musculoskeletal (MSK) impairment from their underlying disease and from treatment. Data are limited on the incidence and nature of these disorders during intensive therapy. This study's objective was to provide a cross-sectional description of MSK impairments in this population. Procedure: Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (rALL), or undergoing HSCT were systematically assessed for MSK impairments as part of Children's Oncology Group study ACCL0934. Assessments occurred at study entry, at 2 months, and at 12 months and included evaluation for signs or symptoms of MSK impairment and the type, site, and diagnosis. Result(s): Six hundred three patients were included. MSK signs or symptoms were present in 48 (8.0%) children at study entry, 64 (13.5%) children at 2 months, and 40 (11.6%) children at 12 months. Arthralgia and/or gait abnormalities were the most common impairments; the knee was the most common site. Arthritis and tendonitis were both rare. Vincristine neuropathy, MSK impacts from central nervous system pathology, and bone or joint pain from underlying cancer were the most common diagnoses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that having rALL (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.07-3.76, p =.03) or obesity (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.12-3.95, p =.02) were risk factors for MSK impairment at study entry. Conclusion(s): MSK impairments are common in this intensively treated patient population, especially in those with rALL and those who are obese.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - An exploratory end point from a recent trial in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma showed that median progression-free survival (PFS) was increased by 10.7 months with denosumab vs zoledronic acid. We performed additional analyses to identify factors that may have contributed to the favorable PFS with denosumab. Ad hoc analyses were performed for patients intending to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; ASCT intent), not intending to undergo ASCT (ASCT no intent), and intent-to-treat according to age (,70 or $70 years) and baseline renal function (#60 mL/min or .60 mL/min creatinine clearance [CrCl]). Of 1718 patients, 930 (54.1%) were in the ASCT-intent subgroup, and 788 (45.9%) were in the ASCT-no-intent subgroup. In the ASCT-intent subgroup, frontline triplet (median PFS, not estimable vs 35.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.65 [0.47-0.90]; descriptive P 5 .009) or bortezomib-only (median PFS, not estimable vs not estimable; HR [95% CI], 0.61 [0.39-0.95]; descriptive P 5 .029) induction regimens demonstrated the strongest PFS benefit favoring denosumab vs zoledronic acid. In the ASCT-no-intent subgroup, no benefit with denosumab vs zoledronic acid was observed. PFS favored denosumab vs zoledronic acid in patients with CrCl .60 mL/min and in patients,70 years old, but no difference was observed in patients with CrCl #60 mL/min or patients $70 years old. The PFS difference observed with denosumab is one of the notable benefits reported in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and was most pronounced in patients intending to undergo ASCT and those who received proteasome inhibitor (PI)2based triplet regimens. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01345019.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Functional reserve of organs and systems is known to be relevant in predicting immunochemotherapy tolerance. Age and comorbidities, assessed by the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), have been used to address chemotherapy intensity. In the ibrutinib era, it is still unclear whether age, CIRS, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) retain their predictive role on treatment vulnerability. In this series of 712 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with ibrutinib outside clinical trials, baseline ECOG-PS and neutropenia resulted as the most accurate predictors of treatment feasibility and outcomes. Age did not independently influence survival and ibrutinib tolerance, indicating that not age per se, but age-related conditions, may affect drug management. We confirmed the role of CIRS . 6 as a predictor of a poorer progression- and event-free survival (PFS, EFS). The presence of a severe comorbidity was significantly associated with permanent dose reductions (PDRs), not translating into worse outcomes. As expected, del(17p) and/or TP53mut and previous therapies affected PFS, EFS, and overall survival. No study so far has analyzed the influence of concomitant medications and CYP3A inhibitors with ibrutinib. In our series, these factors had no impact, although CYP3A4 inhibitors use correlated with Cox regression analysis, with an increased risk of PDR. Despite the limitation of its retrospective nature, this large study confirmed the role of ECOG-PS as the most accurate predictor of ibrutinib feasibility and outcomes, and importantly, neutropenia emerged as a relevant tool influencing patients' vulnerability. Although CIRS > 6 retained a significant impact on PFS and EFS, its value should be confirmed by prospective studies.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Post-transplantation acute limbic encephalitis (PALE) is a rare, severe inflammatory disorder in the bilateral limbic system, including the hippocampus. To date, only a few studies have reported details, including risk factors for PALE; however, further clinical evidence of PALE, especially in cerebrospinal fluid human herpesvirus 6-negative cases, is warranted. In addition, data are sparse regarding the risk factors for calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced encephalopathy (CNIE) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in adults. Therefore, we examined the risk factors for and clinical details of PALE and CNIE. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT between January 2005 and November 2017. A total of 485 patients age 46 years (median) were eligible. In total, 14 PALE cases and 11 CNIE cases were identified. Multivariable analyses identified older age, use of an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (URD), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with CNI and mycophenolate mofetil, and grade II-IV acute GVHD as significantly associated with an increased risk of PALE. In 13 patients who received high-dose methylprednisolone (mPSL) therapy, 6 (46%) responded to mPSL therapy, and 3 (23%) achieved complete remission at day 90 after mPSL administration. Furthermore, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), HLA-mismatched URD, and grade II-IV acute GVHD were significantly associated with an increased risk of CNIE. The 5-year nonrelapse mortality rate was 50% in PALE and 63% in CNIE, suggesting a very poor prognosis. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that HLA-mismatched URD and acute GVHD may independently contribute to the development of PALE, possibly in part through HLA-mismatch-derived alloimmune responses. Other than acute GVHD, we have identified MDS and HLA-mismatched URD as novel predictors of CNIE after allo-HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - To identify the prognostic factors that are useful to improve central nervous system (CNS) control in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we analyzed the outcome of 7640 consecutive patients treated on Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL-2015 protocol between 2015 and 2019. This protocol featured prephase dexamethasone treatment before conventional remission induction and subsequent risk-directed therapy, including 16 to 22 triple intrathecal treatments, without prophylactic cranial irradiation. The 5-year event-free survival was 80.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.9-81.7), and overall survival 91.1% (95% CI, 90.1-92.1). The cumulative risk of isolated CNS relapse was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.5-2.3), and any CNS relapse 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2-3.2). The isolated CNS relapse rate was significantly lower in patients with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) than in those with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0 vs 4.6%; 95% CI, 2.9-6.3; P < .001). Independent risk factors for isolated CNS relapse included male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0; P = .03), the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0-7.3; P < .001) in B-ALL, and presenting leukocyte count >=50x109/L (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.5-12.2; P = .007) in T-ALL. Significantly lower isolated CNS relapse was associated with the use of total intravenous anesthesia during intrathecal therapy (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.04-0.7; P = .02) and flow cytometry examination of diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.6; P = .006) among patients with B-ALL. Prephase dexamethasone treatment, delayed intrathecal therapy, use of total intravenous anesthesia during intrathecal therapy, and flow cytometry examination of diagnostic CSF may improve CNS control in childhood ALL. This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-14005706).Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Prognostic factors for multiple myeloma (MM) after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) are poorly characterised. Two potential factors include minimal residual disease (MRD) and CD3+ donor-specific chimerism. We retrospectively examined 93 consecutive patients who received upfront or deferred tandem auto-alloHSCT. Bone marrow (Euroflow) MRD was assessed pre-alloHSCT and 3-monthly post-alloHSCT. CD3+ donor chimerism was assessed at D30, D60, D90, 6 m and 12 m post-alloHSCT. There was no statistical difference between upfront and deferred transplants in progression free survival (PFS) (34 m vs. 15 m respectively, p = 0.20) and overall survival (OS) (75.5 m vs. 62.7 m respectively, p = 0.56). Patients who were MRD-positive post-alloHSCT had inferior PFS to MRD-negative patients from 6 m (6 m HR 3.32, p = 0.02; 9 m HR 4.08, p = 0.003; 12 m HR 4.47, p = 0.008). Attainment or maintenance of MRD-negativity predicted reduced relapse risk (23.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference in OS between the MRD-negative and positive groups. Full CD3+ donor chimerism at early time points (D30 and D90) was associated with increased risk of acute GVHD (D30 p < 0.001, D90 p = 0.006) and extensive chronic GVHD (D90 p = 0.04), but not PFS or OS. These data support the use of sequential MRD evaluation post-alloHSCT to inform intervention to eradicate persistent or emergent MRD-positive disease.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Most acute leukemia patients receive consecutive intensive chemotherapy, which usually takes several months before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Intensive chemotherapy often induces gastrointestinal adverse events. These adverse events leave patients in a state of malnutrition, leading to a reduction in body weight. In this study, we analyzed the impact of body weight loss before allo-HCT on survival outcomes of acute leukemia patients (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia and mixed phenotype acute leukemia). A loss of body weight (LBW), which was a reduction of body weight from diagnosis or relapse to transplantation, was calculated in 182 acute leukemia patients who received first allo-HCT at our center between June 2006 and September 2019. A receiver operating characteristics curve for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was plotted for defining the cut-off value of LBW. The cutoff value of LBW was defined as 13.2%. A higher LBW was significantly associated with inferior NRM and overall survival (OS) (2-year [2y] NRM 36.1% versus 11.5%, P = .0025; 2y-OS 39.9% versus 65.8%, P = .020). The adverse impact of LBW was also confirmed in multivariate analyses for NRM and OS (HR of NRM 2.74 [1.25-6.03], P = .0012; HR of OS 2.06 [1.00-3.07], P = .0049). The main cause of death included disease progression (n = 34) and infection (n = 35). Death cause by infection was more frequently observed in the high-LBW group (15 cases [35.7%] versus 20 cases [14.3%]; P = .0035). In addition, subgroup analyses based on a combination of the body mass index at diagnosis and LBW were performed. When the non-overweight-low LBW group (body mass index [BMI] <=25 and LBW <=13.2%) was used as a reference in multivariate analysis, the overweight-high LBW group (BMI >25 and LBW >13.2%) showed an increased risk of poor survival outcomes (HR of NRM 4.27 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.82-10.0], P < .001; HR of OS 1.93 [95%, CI 1.00-3.71], P = .050). High LBW was significantly associated with inferior survival outcomes, and the adverse effect of malnutrition might be greater than the favorable effect of the reduction in overweight.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major infectious complication following an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Recent large-scale retrospective studies reported that CMV reactivation is an independent risk factor for poor post-transplant outcomes, although the development of CMV end-organ disease is suppressed by the CMV antiviral preemptive therapy, which has been mainly analyzed for hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute leukemia. However, it remains unclear whether CMV reactivation also has a negative effect on post-transplant outcomes in aplastic anemia (AA). Therefore, we evaluated the clinical relevance of CMV reactivation in patients with AA using the registry database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Adult patients with AA who underwent their first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2017 and who survived with neutrophil engraftment until 100 days post-transplantation were analyzed (n = 672). Patients were monitored using pp65 antigenemia since the time of engraftment, and CMV reactivation in the analysis of this study was defined as the beginning of CMV preemptive or definitive therapy within 100 days post-transplantation. CMV reactivation occurred in 372 (55%) patients, including 19 with CMV end-organ disease. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, patients aged >=40 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .003) who underwent transplantation from HLA-matched related peripheral blood stem cells (HR, 2.85; P = .008), HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow (BM) (HR, 2.01; P = .036), and other stem cell sources (HR, 2.32; P = .007) compared to HLA-matched related BM, CMV reactivation (HR 1.65; P = .042), grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR 1.73; P = .013), and secondary graft failure (HR 7.09; P < .001) had independent risk factors that significantly decreased overall survival, indicating that CMV reactivation, one of the early events at post-transplantation, had a significant negative impact on the long-term prognosis at post-transplantation. This effect was more pronounced in patients aged >=40 years who received a graft from other than HLA-matched related BM. Comparing the causes of death with and without CMV reactivation, no significant difference in the frequency of each cause of death was observed between the 2 groups (P = .453). Improvement of post-transplant CMV management that effectively suppresses CMV reactivation in the early stage at post-transplantation will be required to improve post-transplant outcomes, especially in high-risk patients.

N2  - The plateau phase emerging during the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) is known to last steadily for a certain period, even without treatment. Therefore, the treatment started at plateau phase is expected to be associated with a better outcome. In this study, this hypothesis was evaluated retrospectively for previously treated MM patients in Kansai Myeloma Forum database who received lenalidomide (LEN) with or without dexamethasone for the first time. Disease stability index (DSI) was defined as (maximum - minimum values of M protein during the 90 days before the start of LEN) divided by M-protein values at the start of LEN. The patients were classified into three groups: stable (S), DSI <= 0.25; increasing (I), DSI > 0.25 with increasing M protein; decreasing (D), DSI > 0.25 with decreasing M protein. In univariate analysis of 352 patients, DSI group "I", non-IgG type, serum albumin<3.5 g/dL, and age>=70 were statistically significant prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the former 3 risk factors were statistically significant for poor overall survival. Thus, DSI is an independent prognostic factor for the treatment with LEN for previously treated MM.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome (ML-DS) is associated with good response to chemotherapy, resulting in favorable outcomes. However, no universal prognostic factors have been identified to date. To clarify a subgroup with high risk of relapse, the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) was explored in the AML-D11 trial by the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. MRD was prospectively evaluated at after induction therapy and at the end of all chemotherapy, using flow cytometry (FCM-MRD) and GATA1-targeted deep sequencing (GATA1-MRD). A total of 78 patients were eligible and 76 patients were stratified to the standard risk (SR) group by morphology. In SR patients, FCM-MRD and GATA1-MRD after induction were positive in 5/65 and 7/59 patients, respectively. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 95.0% and 96.7% in the FCM-MRD-negative population, and 60.0% and 80.0% in the positive population. Three-year EFS and OS rates were both 98.1% in the GATA1-MRD-negative population, and 57.1% and 71.4% in the positive population. Adjusted hazard ratios for associations of FCM-MRD with EFS were 14.67 (p = 0.01). Detection of MRD by either FCM or GATA1 after initial induction therapy represents a significant prognostic factor for predicting ML-DS relapse.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The efficacy and clinical significance of pre-conditioning intervention (PCI) before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) not in remission remain inconclusive. The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to clarify the clinical significance of PCI before HCT in patients with non-remission ALL. Patients with non-remission ALL who received HCT between 2005 and 2015 at 16 institutions were included. PCI was objectively defined and classified to three groups according to the intensity of PCI (no, intensive, or moderate). The study cohort consisted of 104 patients with a median age of 38 (range 17-68). A significant decrease of blast percentage in the peripheral blood (PB) was confirmed in both PCI groups, suggesting that PCIs were effective to stabilize the disease activity. The group with moderate PCI had higher nucleated cell count in the BM compared to the group with intensive PCI or the group without PCI. The overall survival (OS) rates of groups with intensive and no PCI showed comparable and significantly better compared to the group with moderate PCI (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the OS of moderate PCI group was significantly worse compared to that of intensive PCI group (HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.32-4.14, P = 0.004), while the OS of intensive PCI group was comparable to that of the group without PCI. These results suggest that the intensity of PCI rather than the response to PCI may contribute to improve the transplant outcome in patients with ALL not in remission.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - A multicenter retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical significance of preconditioning intervention (PCI) before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) not in remission. The study cohort consisted of 519 patients classified according to the intensity (intensive/moderate) of PCI and their response to PCI. The group treated with PCI had higher blast counts in the peripheral blood (PB) and had a lower overall survival (OS) rate (P < .001) and higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate (P = .035) compared with those without PCI (no PCI group). Approximately 40% of the patients (68 of 236) achieved a good response to PCI (good PCI group), and those patients had lower blast counts in the PB compared with the group with poor response to PCI (poor PCI group). OS in the good PCI group was comparable to that in the no PCI group and significantly better than that in the poor PCI group (hazard ratio, .54; 95% confidence interval, .39 to .77; P < .001). However, OS was significantly lower in patients with intensive/moderate PCI compared with the no PCI group. These results suggest that PCI increases NRM without decreasing the post-transplantation relapse rate, but may be beneficial for patients with lower blast counts in PB irrespective of its intensity.

N2  - Selinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export, has demonstrated promising activity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This randomized, phase II study evaluated selinexor 60 mg twice weekly (n = 118) vs. physician's choice (PC) treatment (n = 57) in patients aged >=60 years with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Median OS did not differ significantly for selinexor vs. PC (3.2 vs. 5.6 months; HR = 1.18 [95% CI: 0.79-1.75]; p = 0.422). Complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete hematologic recovery trending in favor of selinexor occurred in a minority of patients. Selinexor treated patients had an increased incidence of adverse events. The most common grade >=3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, hyponatremia. Despite well-balanced baseline characteristics, there were numerically higher rates of TP53 mutations, prior myelodysplastic syndrome, and lower absolute neutrophil counts in the selinexor group; warranting further investigation of selinexor in more carefully stratified R/R AML patients. Registered trial: NCT02088541.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for lenalidomide (Len)-associated skin rash. We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 144 multiple myeloma patients treated with Len-containing therapies. A total of 64 of 144 patients included in the study had skin rash (44.4%). 50 patients developed skin rash within 4 weeks of starting Len treatment. Further, in 29 patients, the skin rash appeared at an early stage (within 1 week) after treatment initiation. Univariate analysis revealed that the risk of skin rash significantly increased in patients with advanced age (p = 0.017), myeloma subtype (p = 0.014), no prior chemotherapy (p = 0.012), and Len dosage (p = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that advanced age (>= 70 years), BJP-subtype of myeloma and no prior chemotherapy were significant risk factors for the skin rash associated with Len. Thus, patients with these risk factors should be carefully monitored for the appearance of skin rash during the treatment with Len.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a premalignant condition, is associated with various chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RDs) and is frequently observed as an incidental finding during routine work-up. The association of MGUS and chronic RDs is well established, but the impact of RDs on the risk of transformation into overt multiple myeloma (MM) has not been evaluated so far. MGUS patients diagnosed between January 2000 and August 2016 were identified and screened for concomitant RDs. RDs were grouped into antibody (Ab)-mediated RDs and non-Ab-mediated RDs (polymyalgia rheumatica, large-vessel giant cell arteritis, spondyloarthritis, and gout). Progression to MM was defined as a categorical (yes/no) or continuous time-dependent (time to progression) variable. Of 2935 MGUS patients, 255 (9%) had a concomitant RD. MGUS patients diagnosed with non-Ab-mediated RDs had a doubled risk of progression compared with those without a concomitant RD (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9; P 5.02). These data translate into a 5-year risk of progression of 4% in MGUS patients without rheumatologic comorbidity, 10% in those with concomitant non-Ab-mediated RDS, and 2% in those with Ab-mediated RDs. By using the complex risk stratification model that includes myeloma protein (M-protein) concentration, immunoglobulin type, and level of free light chain ratio as variables, patients with non-Ab-mediated RDs (n 5 57) had the highest risk for progression (hazard ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.5-30.7; P 5.01) compared with patients with Ab-mediated RDs (n 5 77). Chronic inflammatory diseases have an impact on the risk of MGUS progressing into overt MM, with a doubled risk of transformation observed in patients with non-Ab-mediated RDs. Future research can elucidate whether comorbidities such as RDs should be included in currently applied prognostic MGUS scores.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - The tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) is an important regulator of RAS signaling and frequently affected by mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite the relevance for leukemogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target, the prognostic role is controversial. To investigate the prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations, we analyzed 1529 adult AML patients using next-generation sequencing. PTPN11 mutations were detected in 106 of 1529 (6.93%) patients (median VAF: 24%) in dominant (36%) and subclonal (64%) configuration. Patients with PTPN11 mutations were associated with concomitant mutations in NPM1 (63%), DNMT3A (37%), and NRAS (21%) and had a higher rate of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable cytogenetics (57.8% vs 39.1%; P < .001) and higher white blood cell counts (P = .007) compared with PTPN11 wild-type patients. In a multivariable analysis, PTPN11 mutations were independently associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; P < .001), relapse-free survival (HR: 1.52; P = .013), and a lower rate of complete remission (odds ratio: 0.46; P = .008). Importantly, the deleterious effect of PTPN11 mutations was confined predominantly to the ELN favorable-risk group and patients with subclonal PTPN11 mutations (HR: 2.28; P < .001) but not found with dominant PTPN11 mutations (HR: 1.07; P = .775), presumably because of significant differences within the rate and spectrum of associated comutations. In conclusion, our data suggest an overall poor prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations in AML, which is significantly modified by the underlying cytogenetics and the clonal context in which they occur.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Numerous genetic abnormalities affect treatment outcomes in multiple myeloma. The role of coexistent trisomy or hyperdiploidy and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (CGAs) is not well defined. We assessed the influence of overlapping genetic abnormalities in patients who received frontline autologous stem cell transplantation. A total of 491 consecutive patients between January 2009 and January 2016 were identified. High-risk CGAs included del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and gain 1q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and del(13) by conventional cytogenetics. Thirty-two percent had a trisomy, 27% had a high-risk CGA, and 11% had both. Among patients with any trisomy, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 90%, respectively, compared to 25% and 65%, respectively, for patients with any high-risk CGA. Patients with co-existent trisomy and high-risk CGAs had 3-year PFS and OS of 43% and 89%, respectively, whereas those with isolated high-risk CGAs without trisomy had 3-year PFS and OS of 13% and 49%, respectively. The PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.3; P =.02) and OS (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 13; P =.006) were worse for high-risk CGAs without versus those with concurrent trisomies. Our findings suggest a protective impact of trisomies in patients with high-risk CGAs and a potential need for revised risk stratification assessments to account for overlapping genetic abnormalities.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - IDH1 and IDH2 mutations (IDH1/2Mut) are recognized as recurrent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and associated with both clinical impact and therapeutic opportunity due to the recent development of specific IDH1/2Mut inhibitors. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), their incidence and prognostic implications remain poorly reported. Our targeted next-generation sequencing approach allowed comprehensive assessment of genotype across the entire IDH1 and IDH2 locus in 1085 consecutive unselected and newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL and identified 4% of, virtually exclusive (47 of 49 patients), IDH1/2Mut. Mutational patterns of IDH1/2Mut in T-ALL present some specific features compared to AML. Whereas IDH2R140Q mutation was frequent in T-ALL (25 of 51 mutations), the IDH2R172 AML hotspot was absent. IDH2 mutations were associated with older age, an immature phenotype, more frequent RAS gain-of-function mutations and epigenetic regulator loss-of-function alterations (DNMT3A and TET2). IDH2 mutations, contrary to IDH1 mutations, appeared to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis with the NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN classifier. IDH2Mut were significantly associated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse and very dismal outcome, suggesting that IDH2-mutated T-ALL cases should be identified at diagnosis in order to benefit from therapeutic intensification and/or specific IDH2 inhibitors.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The value of measurable residual disease (MRD) in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is inconsistent between those treated with intensive vs hypomethylating drugs, and unknown after semi-intensive therapy. We investigated the role of MRD in refining complete remission (CR) and treatment duration in the phase 3 FLUGAZA clinical trial, which randomized 283 elderly AML patients to induction and consolidation with fludarabine plus cytarabine (FLUGA) vs 5-azacitidine. After consolidation, patients continued treatment if MRD was $0.01% or stopped if MRD was,0.01%, as assessed by multidimensional flow cytometry (MFC). On multivariate analysis including genetic risk and treatment arm, MRD status in patients achieving CR (N 5 72) was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR, 3.45; P 5 .002). Achieving undetectable MRD significantly improved RFS of patients with adverse genetics (HR, 0.32; P 5 .013). Longer overall survival was observed in patients with undetectable MRD after induction though not after consolidation. Although leukemic cells from most patients displayed phenotypic aberrancies vs their normal counterpart (N 5 259 of 265), CD34 progenitors from cases with undetectable MRD by MFC carried extensive genetic abnormalities identified by whole-exome sequencing. Interestingly, the number of genetic alterations significantly increased from diagnosis to MRD stages in patients treated with FLUGA vs 5-azacitidine (2.2-fold vs 1.1-fold; P 5 .001). This study supports MRD assessment to refine CR after semi-intensive therapy or hypomethylating agents, but unveils that improved sensitivity is warranted to individualize treatment and prolong survival of elderly AML patients achieving undetectable MRD.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Background: Diagnosis and remission status at the time of allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) are the principal determinants of overall survival following transplantation. We sought to develop a contemporary disease-risk stratification system (DRSS) that accounts for heterogeneous transplantation indications. Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study we included 55 histology and remission status combinations across haematological malignancies, including acute leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders. A total of 47 265 adult patients (aged >=18 years) who received an allogeneic HSCT between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2016, and were reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry were included. We divided EBMT patients into derivation (n=25 534), tuning (n=18 365), and geographical validation (n=3366) cohorts. Disease combinations were ranked in a multivariable Cox regression for overall survival in the derivation cohort, cutoff for risk groups were evaluated for the tuning cohort, and the selected system was tested on the geographical validation cohort. An independent single-centre US cohort of 660 patients transplanted between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2015 was used to externally validate the results. Finding(s): The DRSS model stratified patients in the derivation cohort (median follow-up was 2.1 years [IQR 1.0-3.2]) into five risk groups with increasing mortality risk: low risk (reference group), intermediate-1 (hazard ratio for overall survival 1.26 [95% CI 1.17-1.36], p<0.0001), intermediate-2 (1.53 [1.42-1.66], p<0.0001), high (2.03 [1.86-2.22], p<0.0001), and very high (2.87 [2.63-3.13], p<0.0001). DRSS levels were also associated with a stepwise increase in risk across the tuning and geographical validation cohort. In the external validation cohort (median follow-up was 5.7 years [IQR 4.5-7.1]), the DRSS scheme separated patients into 4 risk groups associated with increasing risk of mortality: intermediate-2 risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34 [95% CI 1.04-1.74], p=0.025), high risk (HR 2.03 [95% CI 1.39-2.95], p=0.00023) and very-high risk (HR 2.26 [95% CI 1.62-3.15], p<0.0001) patients compared with the low risk and intermediate-1 risk group (reference group). Across all cohorts, between 64% and 65% of patients were categorised as having intermediate-risk disease by a previous prognostic system (ie, the disease-risk index [DRI]). The DRSS reclassified these intermediate-risk DRI patients, with 855 (6%) low risk, 7111 (51%) intermediate-1 risk, 5700 (41%) intermediate-2 risk, and 375 (3%) high risk or very high risk of 14 041 patients in a subanalysis combining the tuning and internal geographic validation cohorts. The DRI projected 2-year overall survival was 62.1% (95% CI 61.2-62.9) for these 14 041 patients, while the DRSS reclassified them into finer prognostic groups with overall survival ranging from 45.7% (37.4-54.0; very high risk patients) to 73.1% (70.1-76.2; low risk patients). Interpretation(s): The DRSS is a novel risk stratification tool including disease features related to histology, genetic profile, and treatment response. The model should serve as a benchmark for future studies. This system facilitates the interpretation and analysis of studies with heterogeneous cohorts, promoting trial-design with more inclusive populations.

N2  - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a group of aggressive lymphomas commonly treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). Progression-free survival at 24 months (PFS24) constitutes a survival predictor for some lymphomas but has not been examined in Asian populations. We retrospectively investigated whether PFS24 was predictive of survival outcomes after CHOP treatment in 73 Japanese patients with PTCL. Patients without PFS24 had shorter median subsequent overall survival (OS) (20.2 vs. 121.0 months, p < 0.001) and shorter median subsequent progression-free survival (5.0 vs. 17.1 months, p = 0.03). Patients without PFS24 had worse overall (62.5% vs. 100%) and complete response rates (45.8% vs. 96.0%) (both p < 0.001). PFS24 absence (hazard ratio: 3.34, p = 0.004) and poor performance status (hazard ratio: 3.17, p = 0.04) were independently predictive of shorter OS. These findings suggest that PFS24 is predictive of survival after CHOP treatment in Japanese patients with PTCL.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Allogeneic haematopoietic-cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is usually associated with lower non-relapse mortality (NRM), higher relapse rate and similar overall-survival (OS) as myeloablative-conditioning (MAC). Fludarabine/treosulfan (FT) is a reduced-toxicity regimen with intense anti-leukaemia activity and a favourable toxicity profile. We investigated post-transplant outcomes in 1722 MDS patients following allo-HCT with FT (n = 367), RIC (n = 687) or MAC (n = 668). FT and RIC recipients were older than MAC recipients, median age 59, 59 and 51 years, respectively (P < 0.001) but other disease characteristics were similar. The median follow-up was 64 months (1-171). Five-year relapse rates were 25% (21-30), 38% (34-42) and 25% (22-29), after FT, RIC and MAC, respectively, (P < 0.001). NRM was 30% (25-35), 27% (23-30) and 34% (31-38, P = 0.008), respectively. Five-year OS was 50% (44-55), 43% (38-47), and 43% (39-47), respectively (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, FT was associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.55, P < 0.001) and better OS (HR 0.72, P = 0.01). MAC was associated with higher NRM (HR 1.44, P = 0.001). In conclusion, FT is associated with similar low relapse rates as MAC and similar low NRM as RIC, resulting in improved OS. FT may be the preferred regimen for allo-HCT in MDS.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curable treatment option for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The study aim was to evaluate epidemiological data and identify prognostic factors for AYA patients with MDS undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Here, 645 patients were selected from patients enrolled in a multicenter prospective registry for HSCT from 2000 to 2015. The primary endpoint was 3-year overall survival (OS). Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were identified using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. The 3-year OS was 71.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.4-74.6%). In multivariable analysis, active disease status (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.09-2.18, p = 0.016), poor cytogenetic risk (1.62, 1.12-2.36, p = 0.011), poor performance status (2.01, 1.13-3.56, p = 0.016), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donors (2.23, 1.39-3.59, p < 0.001), HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (2.16, 1.09-4.28, p = 0.027), and cord blood transplantation (2.44, 1.43-4.17, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with poor 3-year OS. In conclusion, in AYA patients with MDS the 3-year OS following allogeneic HSCT was 71.2%. Active disease status, poor cytogenetic risk, poor performance status, and donor sources other than related donors were associated with poor 3-year OS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Variables associated with self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms were explored in 1169 adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-therapy. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale questionnaires were used to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. Two hundred and fifty-one (22.4%) and 415 (37.1%) respondents reported anxiety and depression, respectively. In multivariate analyses, female sex, lower education level, comorbidities, advanced-line TKI-therapy, and longer TKI-therapy duration were significantly associated with more severe anxiety and/or depression. It is concluded that socio-demographics, comorbidities, advanced-line TKI-therapy, and longer TKI-therapy duration were significantly associated with anxiety and/or depression symptoms in CML patients receiving TKI-therapy.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - We retrospectively studied the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities in 328 consecutive newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCAs) included del (17p), amp/gain (1q21), t(4;14), and t(14;16). We defined a standard-risk group by the absence of HRCA, an intermediate-risk group with one HRCA, and a high-risk (HiR) group with at least two HRCAs. The HiR group constituted 14.3% of patients and was associated with a median overall survival (OS) of 28.6 months and progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.0 months. Moreover, the HiR group predicted poor outcomes for OS and PFS in multivariate analyses, and bortezomib prolongation to nine cycles could not bring additional benefit to this entity, suggesting the necessity of more effective therapies for these patients. Furthermore, we confirmed the independent prognostic impact of amp 1q21 in this real-world study.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Long-term outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs) are dismal. There are few multicenter studies defining prognostic factors in pediatric patients with tMNs. We have accumulated the largest cohort of pediatric patients who have undergone HCT for a tMN to perform a multivariate analysis defining factors predictive of long-term survival. Sixty-eight percent of the 401 patients underwent HCT using a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen, but there were no statistically significant differences in the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), or cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality based on the conditioning intensity. Among the recipients of MAC regimens, 38.4% of deaths were from treatment-related causes, especially acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and end-organ failure, as compared to only 20.9% of deaths in the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) cohort. Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) during conditioning and experiencing grade III/IV acute GVHD was associated with worse OS. In addition, a diagnosis of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and having a structurally complex karyotype at tMN diagnosis were associated with worse EFS. Reduced-toxicity (but not reduced-intensity) regimens might help to decrease relapse while limiting mortality associated with TBI-based HCT conditioning in pediatric patients with tMNs.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are considered at high risk of poor outcomes after COVID-19 on the basis of their immunosuppressed status, but data from large studies in HSCT recipients are lacking. This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. Method(s): In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. Finding(s): 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 2.53, 95% CI 1.16-5.52; p=0.020); male sex (3.53; 1.44-8.67; p=0.006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (2.67, 1.33-5.36; p=0.005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (2.41, [1.08-5.38]; p=0.033) in autologous HSCT recipients. Interpretation(s): Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

N2  - Disease relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for high-risk acute leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Comprehensive data on outcomes after post-transplant relapse are lacking, especially in pediatric patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of various transplant-, patient-, and disease-related variables on survival and outcomes in patients who relapse after alloHCT. We describe our institutional experience with 221 pediatric patients who experienced disease relapse after their first alloHCT for acute leukemias or MDS between 1990 and 2018. In a multivariable model, being in first complete remission at first alloHCT, longer duration of remission after alloHCT, experiencing GVHD and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a second alloHCT after post-transplant relapse. Of these variables, only longer interval from alloHCT to relapse, receiving a second alloHCT or DLI, and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were associated with improved overall survival. Our data support pursuing second alloHCT for patients who have experienced relapse after their first transplant, as that remains the only salvage modality with a reasonable chance of inducing long-term remission.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) remains a major therapeutic challenge. While patients with longer remission after initial alloSCT are recommended to receive cell therapy (CT) such as 2ndalloSCT or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), survival for patients who relapse within 6 months of alloSCT has been dismal. We evaluated the outcomes of AML relapse after alloSCT to assess the impact of different treatments on long-term survival. One hundred and seventy-two patients with AML underwent alloSCT at the Penn State Cancer Institute from January 2014 to August 2019. Sixty-nine patients relapsed (median age, 60 years; range, 10-75). Of these, 4 patients underwent 2ndalloSCT, and 26 received DLI. One-year overall survival (OS) in all cases was 20.3% (95% CI: 11.8-30.4%). Patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 at relapse showed a better 1-year OS than those with PS 3-4. Median OS for patients who received chemotherapy only or chemotherapy with CT was 74 or 173.5 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Relapsed patients receiving conventional re-induction chemotherapy were categorized as the high-intensity chemotherapy (H) group, while those receiving treatments such as hypomethylating agents or targeted agents were categorized as the low-intensity chemotherapy (L) group. The H group showed a better 1-year OS compared with the L group. Patients who received H + CT showed a better 1-year OS of 52.9% than the other 3 groups (p < 0.001). Even for patients with post-alloSCT remission duration of less than 6 months, the statistical significance was preserved. Factors including age, donor source at 1stalloSCT, time to relapse, blast counts, PS at relapse, and treatment type after post-alloSCT relapse were used for a multivariate analysis, and matched or mismatched related donor and H + CT after alloSCT were identified as independent factors associated with OS. These findings support the use of H + CT as the treatment option of choice for AML patients who relapse after alloSCT when feasible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Donor KIR and recipient HLA combinations that minimize inhibition and favor activation of the NK repertoire are associated with improved outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myeloid neoplasia. We prospectively evaluated a weighted donor ranking algorithm designed to prioritize HLA-compatible unrelated donors (URDs) with weak inhibitory KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 interaction, followed by donors with nontolerized activating KIR2DS1, and finally those with KIR centromeric B haplotype. During donor evaluation, we performed KIR genotyping and ranked 2079 URDs for 527 subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Among all patients, 394 (75%) had at least 1 KIR-advantageous donor, and 263 (50%) underwent HCT. In patients with AML, KIR3DL1 weak inhibition provided protection from relapse. Compared with KIR3DL1-Weak Inhibiting donors, KIR3DL1-Noninteracting donors were associated with increased risk of relapse (HR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.33-6.64; P = .008) and inferior event-free survival (EFS; HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .015). KIR3DL1-Strong Inhibiting donors were associated with HR, 1.65 (95% CI, 0.66-4.08; P = .25) for AML relapse and HR, 1.6 (95% CI, 0.81-3.17; P = .1) for EFS when compared with the use of KIR3DL1-weak inhibiting donors. Donor KIR2DS1/HLA-C1 status and centromeric KIR haplotype-B content were not associated with decreased risk of AML relapse. There was no benefit to KIR-based donor selection in patients with MDS. This study demonstrates that donor KIR typing is feasible, and prioritization of donors with certain KIR3DL1 genotypes may confer a protection from relapse after HCT in patients with AML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) offers cure chance for various hematologic malignancies, but graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major impediment. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is used for prophylactic T-cell depletion and GVHD prevention, but there are no clear guidelines for the optimal dosing of ATG. It is suspected that for patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), current weight-based dosing of ATG can be excessive, which can result in profound T-cell depletion and poor transplant outcome. Method(s): The objective of the study is to evaluate the association of low preconditioning ALC with outcomes in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) alloSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and ATG. We conducted a single-center retrospective longitudinal cohort study of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients over 18 years old undergoing alloSCT. In total, 64 patients were included and dichotomized into lower ALC and higher ALC groups with the cutoff of 500/mul on D-7. Result(s): Patients with preconditioning ALC <500/mul were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and higher infectious mortality. The incidence of acute GVHD and moderate-severe chronic GVHD as well as relapse rates did not differ according to preconditioning ALC. In multivariate analyses, low preconditioning ALC was recognized as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS. Conclusion(s): Patients with lower ALC are exposed to excessive dose of ATG, leading to profound T-cell depletion that results in higher infectious mortality and shorter OS. Our results call for the implementation of more creative dosing regimens for patients with low preconditioning ALC.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

N2  - Several prospective randomized trials comparing conditioning intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have been performed, with conflicting results. Although reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) leads to lower treatment-related mortality (TRM), this is offset by higher rates of relapse. Long-term follow-up of randomized comparative trials are limited. Here we present long-term follow-up of a randomized comparison of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) compared with RIC before HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS). Long-term comparative analyses of overall survival, relapse, and relapse-free survival were performed. Patients age 18 to 65 years with <5% marrow myeloblasts were randomized to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137), followed by HCT from an HLA-matched donor. The primary endpoint of the trial was an 18-month pointwise comparison of overall survival. The analyses were performed using a proportional hazards model. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 51 months. At 4 years, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 25.1% for MAC, compared with 9.9% for RIC (P < .001). Patients who received RIC had a significantly higher risk of relapse compared to those who received MAC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.06; 95% CI, 2.59 to 6.35; P < 0.001). Among the patients who relapsed after HCT, postrelapse survival was similar at 3 years (24% for MAC and 26% for RIC). Overall survival was superior for patients who received MAC compared to those who received RIC (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.2; P = .03). Our data show that patients who received MAC were at higher risk of late TRM compared with those who received RIC; however, because of the exceedingly high rates of relapse in the RIC arm, overall survival remained significantly better for patients who received MAC. Among patients with MDS or AML eligible for either MAC or RIC regimens, long-term follow up demonstrates a survival advantage for patients who received MAC.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Extreme gradient boosting methods outperform conventional machine-learning models. Here, we have developed the LEukemia Artificial intelligence Program (LEAP) with the extreme gradient boosting decision tree method for the optimal treatment recommendation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). A cohort of CML-CP patients was randomly divided into training/validation (N = 504) and test cohorts (N = 126). The training/validation cohort was used for 3-fold cross validation to develop the LEAP CML-CP model using 101 variables at diagnosis. The test cohort was then applied to the LEAP CML-CP model and an optimum TKI treatment was suggested for each patient. The area under the curve in the test cohort was 0.81899.Backward multivariate analysis identified age at diagnosis, the degree of comorbidities, and TKI recommended therapy by the LEAP CML-CP model as independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The bootstrapping method internally validated the association of the LEAP CML-CP recommendation with overall survival as an independent prognostic for overall survival. Selecting treatment according to the LEAP CML-CP personalized recommendations, in this model, is associated with better survival probability compared to treatment with a LEAP CML-CP non-recommended therapy. This approach may pave a way of new era of personalized treatment recommendations for patients with cancer.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Background: There is no information on the impact of donor type in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) using homogeneous graft-versus-host (GVHD) prophylaxis with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of adult patients with ALL in CR1 that had received HCT with PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis from HLA-matched sibling (MSD) (n = 78), matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 94) and haploidentical family (Haplo) (n = 297) donors registered in the EBMT database between 2010 and 2018. The median follow-up period of the entire cohort was 2.2 years. Result(s): Median age of patients was 38 years (range 18-76). Compared to MSD and MUD, Haplo patients received peripheral blood less frequently. For Haplo, MUD, and MSD, the cumulative incidence of 100-day acute GVHD grade II-IV and III-IV, and 2-year chronic and extensive chronic GVHD were 32%, 41%, and 34% (p = 0.4); 13%, 15%, and 15% (p = 0.8); 35%, 50%, and 42% (p = 0.01); and 11%, 17%, and 21% (p = 0.2), respectively. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality was 20%, 20%, and 28% (p = 0.8); and 21%, 18%, and 21% (p = 0.8) for Haplo, MUD, and MSD, respectively. The leukemia-free survival, overall survival and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival for Haplo, MUD, and MSD was 59%, 62%, and 51% (p = 0.8); 66%, 69%, and 62% (p = 0.8); and 46%, 44%, and 35% (p = 0.9), respectively. On multivariable analysis, transplant outcomes did not differ significantly between donor types. TBI-based conditioning was associated with better LFS. Conclusion(s): Donor type did not significantly affect transplant outcome in patient with ALL receiving SCT with PTCy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - We retrospectively compared outcomes of a large series of adult patients with APL in CR2 receiving alloHSCT (n = 228) or autoHSCT (n = 341) reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation from January 2004 to December 2018. The 2-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was significantly higher for alloHSCT 17.3% (95% CI 12.5-22.8) compared with autoHSCT 2.7% (95% CI 1.2-5) (p = 0.001), while differences in relapse rate were not significant (28% versus 22.9%; p = 0.28). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) favored autoHSCT with 74.5% (95% CI 69-79.2) and 82.4% (95% CI 77.3-86.5) compared with alloHSCT with 54.7% (95% CI 47.5-61.3) (p = 0.001) and 64.3% (95% CI 57.2-70.6), respectively (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed significantly worse LFS after alloHSCT (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.37-0.67; p < 0.0001), older age (p = 0.001), and shorter time from diagnosis to transplant (p = 0.00015). Similar results were obtained for OS. The study shows that autoHSCT resulted in better survival outcomes (LFS and OS) for APL in CR2. These results were mainly due to reduced NRM in the autoHSCT as compared to alloHSCT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma (BL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) have a high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which is associated with poor prognosis. The hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone plus rituximab (CVAD-R) regimen includes systemic and intrathecal CNS-directed therapy to treat and prevent CNS disease. We report here the long-term safety and efficacy of the hyper-CVAD-R regimen in adults with BL and HGBL, focusing on its efficacy to prevent CNS relapse. Among 79 adults (54 BL, 25 HGBL), the median age was 44 years (25% $60 years old), 73% had bone marrow (BM) involvement, and 28% had CNS involvement. The complete response rate was 91% (BL 96%; HGBCL 79%; P 5.16). The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58% and 52%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 21% (BL 14%; HGBCL 37%, P 5.06) and was associated with baseline BM (27% vs 0%; P 5.02) and CNS (42% vs 12%; P,.01) involvement. In multivariate analyses, age and CNS involvement were independent predictors for OS and RFS. The 5-year CNS CIR was 6% (BL 4%; HGBL 11%; P 5.31); 16% with baseline CNS involvement (P 5.03). Our data support the use of hyper-CVAD-R in preventing CNS relapse, especially among high-risk patients with BM or CNS involvement.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Recent compelling evidence showed that innate immune effector cells could recognize allogeneic grafts and prime an adaptive immune response. Signal regulatory protein a (SIRPalpha) is an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor that is expressed on myeloid cells; the interaction between SIRPalpha and its ubiquitously expressed ligand CD47 elicits an inhibitory signal that suppresses macrophage phagocytic function. Additional studies showed that donor-recipient mismatch in SIRPalpha variants might activate monocytic allorecognition, possibly as the result of non-self SIRPalpha-CD47 interaction. However, the frequency of SIRPalpha variation and its role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unexplored. We studied 350 patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent HLA-matched related HSCT and found that SIRPalpha allelic mismatches were present in 39% of transplantation pairs. SIRPalpha variant mismatch was associated with a significantly higher rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; P = .03), especially de novo chronic GVHD (HR, 2.0; P = .01), after adjusting for other predictors. Those with mismatched SIRPalpha had a lower relapse rate (HR, 0.6; P = .05) and significantly longer relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.6; P = .04). Notably, the effect of SIRPalpha variant mismatch on relapse protection was most pronounced early after HSCT and in patients who were not in remission at HSCT (cumulative incidence, 73% vs 54%; HR, 0.5; P = .01). These findings show that SIRPalpha variant mismatch is associated with HSCT outcomes, possibly owing to innate allorecognition. SIRPalpha variant matching could provide valuable information for donor selection and risk stratification in HSCT.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HaploHCT) is an alternative treatment option for patients without a suitable 10/10 HLA matched donor. We share an updated experience at our center of using in vivo dual T-cell depletion with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in peripheral blood haploHCT and report the impact of reducing the dose of ATG from 4.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg on post-transplantation complications and outcomes. Ninety-five consecutive adults underwent haploHCT at our center between August 2016 and February 2020, all of whom were included in the study. Nine (9.5%) patients received myeloablative conditioning, and 86 (90.5%) patients underwent reduced-intensity haploHCT. All patients received thymoglobulin, PTCy and cyclosporine (CsA) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Sixty (63.2%) patients received 4.5 mg/kg, and 35 (36.8%) patients received 2 mg/kg of ATG. Clinical information was collected retrospectively and updated in June 2020. The median age was 57 (18-73), and acute myeloid leukemia was the most prevalent diagnosis (58.9%). The day 100 cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGVHD, and 1-year moderate/severe cGVHD were 22.3%, 11.1%, and 20.2%, respectively. Those patients who received 2 mg/kg of ATG had higher incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD (23.9% vs 3.5%, P = .006) and comparable moderate/severe cGVHD (1-year 20.6% vs 19.8%, P = .824) than those patients who received 4.5 mg/kg. Overall, the 18-month overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 43.8%, 38.4%, and 40.2%, respectively. The reduction of the ATG dose did not have a significant impact in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, P = .847), RFS (HR 0.984, P = .955), and in NRM (HR 1.38; P = .348). The reduction of the ATG resulted in a negative impact on aGVHD without conferring any benefit in OS, RFS, and NRM. Consequently, the ATG dose used at our institution in combination with PTCy and CsA for haploHCT continues to be 4.5 mg/kg.Copyright © 2021

N2  - BK virus is one of the most common causes of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Viruses can be found in urine and serum samples of immunocompromised patients. Malignant diseases, age, cell source, day of granulocyte reconstitution, conditioning regimen, or use of total body irradiation may play an important role in BKV epidemiology, development of hemorrhagic cystitis course, and outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, clinical course, and risk factors for BKV-HC in children undergoing HCT. A total number of 133 patients who were prospectively tested for BKV colonization/infection were enrolled into this multicenter analysis. Episodes of BKV-HC occurred in 36/133 (27%) enrolled subjects. In a univariate analysis for BKV-HC incidence, the following factors were significant: age >5 years, peripheral blood transplantation, matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation, busulfan-cyclophosphamide-melphalan conditioning regimen, and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) diagnosis. Presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in liver and gut GVHD was a significant risk factor of BKV-HC. No BKV-attributed deaths were reported. In multivariate analysis, the incidence of HC was significantly higher in patients with AML, age >5 years, MUD transplants, and children with GVHD. HC is a frequent complication after HCT among children causes prolonged hospitalization but rarely contributes to death. We identified risk factors of BKV-HC development in children, with focus on aGVHD: we concluded that excessive immune reaction connected with GVHD and immunosuppression drugs might play a pivotal role in the development of BKV-HC.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) commonly develop extramedullary disease (EMD), which comprises central nervous system (CNS) lesions and myeloid sarcoma (MS). In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to determine the effect of EMD on the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 678 pediatric patients with de novo AML (median age, 7 years; range, 0.3-15 years) between 2006 and 2016. We compared the outcomes between patients with (EMD group, n = 158; CNS lesion, n = 47, CNS lesion + MS, n = 9, and MS, n = 102) and without EMD at diagnosis (non-EMD group, n = 520). Survivors were followed for a median of 4.5 years, and the 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 60.6% and 56.4% in the EMD and non-EMD groups, respectively (P = 0.60). No significant differences in OS were observed with respect to the EMD site, except bone lesions, which were associated with poor OS after HCT in a non-remission status. A multivariate analysis revealed that EMD did not affect the outcomes of HCT. In conclusion, the study findings suggest that EMD should not be considered a poor prognostic factor in HCT for children with AML.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains among the major causes of treatment failure in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). The use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is now a well-established and widely used method for GVHD prophylaxis after HLA haploidentical HCT. However, the rationale for using PT-Cy in the setting of matched donor transplantation is less apparent, given the lesser degree of bidirectional alloreactivity. In this retrospective study, we investigated the role of PT-Cy as GVHD prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma underoing allo-HCT, among different donor types, to determine cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and impact on engraftment, progression-free survival (PFS), GVHD-free/relapse- free survival (GRFS), overall survival (OS), and NRM A total of 295 patients with MM underwent allo-HCT using grafts from a matched related donor (MRD; n = 67), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 72), mismatched related or unrelated donor (MMRD/MMUD, 1 antigen; n = 27), or haploidentical donor (haplo; n = 129) using PT-Cy between 2012 and 2018. In addition to PT-Cy, agents used in GVHD prophylaxis included calcineurin inhibitors in 239 patients (81%), with mycophenolate mofetil in 184 of those 239 (77%). For grade II-IV acute GVHD, the cumulative incidence at day +100 was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25% to 36%), 9% (95% CI, 5% to 12%) for grade III-IV acute GVHD, and 27% (95% CI, 21% to 32%) for chronic GVHD (limited, 21%; extensive, 6%), with no differences by donor type. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 19d (95% CI, 18-19), with no significant difference by donor type. The median time to platelet engraftment was delayed in haploidentical donor graft recipients (27 days versus 21 days; P < .001). Two-year OS, PFS, GRFS, and NRM were 51% (95% CI, 45% to 58%), 26% (95% CI, 20% to 32%), 24% (95% CI, 18% to 30%), and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%), respectively, with no significant difference between different donor types. In multivariable analyses, compared with the haplo donors, the use of MRDs was associated with significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.95; P = .029), and the use of MUDs was associated with a significantly higher GRFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.97; P = .034). There was a trend toward improved PFS with use of MUDs (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.04; P = .08). Our data show that PT-Cy in MM patients undergoing allo-HCT resulted in low rates of acute and chronic GVHD and led to favorable survival, especially in the matched related donor setting. © 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

N2  - T-cell replete hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a haploidentical donor followed by high doses of cyclophosphamide has been demonstrated to provide the best chances of a cure for many children in need of an allograft but who lack both a sibling and an unrelated donor. In this study we retrospectively compared the outcome of pediatric patients undergoing T-replete haploidentical HSCT (Haplo) for acute leukemia with those undergoing transplantation from unrelated HLA-matched donor (MUD) and HLA mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) from 2012 to 2017 at our Center. Both univariable and multivariable analyses showed similar 5-year overall survival rates for MUD, MMUD, and Haplo patients: 71% (95% CI 56-86), 72% (95% CI 55-90), and 75% (95% CI 54-94), respectively (p = 0.97). Haplo patients showed reduced event-free survival rates compared to MUD and MMUD patients: 30% (95% CI 12-49) versus 70% (95% CI 55-84) versus 53% (95% CI 35-73), respectively (p = 0.007), but these data were not confirmed by a multivariable analysis. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were similar for the three groups. Therefore, our data confirm that Haplo is a suitable clinical option for pediatric patients needing HSCT when lacking both an MUD and an MMUD donor.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The standard of care for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) is rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, with/without chemotherapy. However, multiple relapses are common in these patients. This phase 3, randomized study compared outcomes of a combination of ofatumumab (a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody) and bendamustine, with bendamustine alone in patients unresponsive to prior rituximab-based treatment. Overall, 346 patients were randomized to receive either the combination or bendamustine alone. Bendamustine was given for <=8 cycles and ofatumumab for <=12 cycles. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS) after 215 protocol-defined events assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Median IRC-assessed PFS was 16.7 and 13.8 months in the combination and monotherapy arms respectively [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82; P = 0.1390]. Median overall survival (OS) was 58.2 and 51.8 months in the combination and monotherapy arms respectively (HR = 0.89, P = 0.4968). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. Overall, 73% and 80% of patients in the combination and monotherapy arms, respectively, experienced a >=grade 3 adverse event. The study did not meet its primary end-point. No significant improvement in PFS and OS was seen with the combination of ofatumumab and bendamustine as compared with bendamustine alone in rituximab-refractory iNHL (NCT01077518).Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I mismatches that trigger donor-versus-recipient natural killer (NK)-cell alloreactivity reduce the incidence of leukemia relapse and improve survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients after T-cell-depleted HLA-haplotype mismatched ("haploidentical") hematopoietic transplantation. In murine graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) models, alloreactive NK-cells also prevent GvHD. Here we report the results of a non-interventional, prospective study performed on behalf of the Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The study was aimed at re-assessing the role of NK-cell alloreactivity in a cohort of haploidentical transplants performed in Europe between 2012 and 2015 and composed of unmanipulated, as well as T-cell-depleted transplants. One hundred thirty-eight patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemias were analyzed. Eighty-six patients received ex-vivo T-cell-depleted transplants, 52 patients received unmanipulated transplants. Fifty patients were transplanted from NK alloreactive donors, 88 from non-NK alloreactive donors. NK cell alloreactivity did not impact on GvHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) in unmanipulated transplants (HR: 1.66 (0.9-3.1), p = 0.1). In contrast, it did impact beneficially on GRFS in T-cell-depleted transplants (HR: 0.6, (0.3-1.2), p = 0.14, interaction p < 0.001). This effect was the consequence of reduced incidences of acute and chronic GvHD and non-relapse mortality.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The use of haplo-HCT with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is a new standard in the treatment of hematological diseases. A paucity of data exists on risk factors for engraftment failure in haplo-HCT with PT-Cy. We analyzed 1939 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received a first haplo-HCT from 2010 to 2019. Status at haplo-HCT was first complete remission (CR1) in 72.5% of patients, secondary AML was reported in 9.9%. Median follow-up was 24.4 months and median age at haplo-HCT was 51 years. Stem cell source was bone marrow (BM) in 42% and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) in 58%, and 64% of patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Cumulative incidence of primary graft failure (GF) was 6%; GF was reported in 110 patients and 54 died before day +30 with no sign of cell recovery. Overall, 33 patients underwent a second HCT in a median time of 45 days and 13 were alive at last follow-up, the 2-year overall survival (OS) after second HCT being 32.4%. In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with the risk of nonengraftment were: secondary AML (HR 1.30, p = 0.003), use of RIC (HR 1.22, p < 0.001), and use of BM (HR 1.21, p < 0.001). At 2 years, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and OS for the entire population was 55.2% (95% CI: 52.6-57.6) and 60.9% (95% CI: 58.4-63.3), respectively. Incidence of GF after haplo-HCT with PT-Cy is lower than reported T-cell-depleted haplo-HCT. Optimization of conditioning regimen and graft source should be considered for reducing the risk of GF in haplo-HCT recipients using PT-Cy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - HLA-haploidentical transplantation (haplo-HCT) using post-transplantation-cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is a feasible procedure in children with malignancies. However, large studies on Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are lacking. We analyzed haplo-HCT outcomes in 180 children with ALL. Median age was 9 years, and median follow-up was 2.7 years. Disease status was CR1 for 24%, CR2 for 45%, CR+3 for 12%, and active disease for 19%. All patients received PT-Cy day +3 and +4. Bone marrow (BM) was the stem cell source in 115 patients (64%). Cumulative incidence of 42-day engraftment was 88.9%. Cumulative incidence of day-100 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 28%, and 2-year chronic GVHD was 21.9%. At 2 years, cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19.6%. Cumulative incidence was 41.9% for relapse and 25% for patients in CR1. Estimated 2-year leukemia free survival was 65%, 44%, and 18.8% for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, CR3+ and 3% at 1 year for active disease. In multivariable analysis for patients in CR1 and CR2, disease status (CR2 [hazard ratio {HR} = 2.19; P = .04]), age at HCT older than 13 (HR = 2.07; P = .03) and use of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) (HR = 1.98; P = .04) were independent factors associated with decreased overall survival. Use of PBSC was also associated with higher NRM (HR = 3.13; P = .04). Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy is an option for children with ALL, namely those transplanted in CR1 and CR2. Age and disease status remain the most important factors for outcomes. BM cells as a graft source is associated with improved survival.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Population-based studies that contain detailed clinical data on patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are scarce. This study focused on the real-world overall survival (OS) of MDS patients in association with comorbidities, specifically malignancies. An observational population-based study using the HemoBase registry was performed, including all patients with MDS diagnosed between 2005 and 2017 in Friesland, a Dutch province. Detailed information about diagnosis, patient characteristics, previous treatment of malignancies, and comorbidities according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was collected from electronic health records. Patients were followed up until June 2019. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression analyses were used to study survival differences. In the 291 patients diagnosed with MDS, the median OS was 25.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3-30.2). OS was significantly better for patients with CCI score ,4, age ,65 years, female sex, and low-risk MDS. Fifty-seven patients (20%) had encountered a prior malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and a majority (38 patients; 67%) were therapy related. Both therapy-related and secondary MDSs were associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.23 and 1.58; 95% CI, 0.95-2.65, respectively), as compared with de novo MDS patients (P 5 .04). Patients in remission at time of MDS diagnosis had a similar median OS compared with patients with de novo MDS (25.5 vs 28.3 months). This population-based study involving all newly diagnosed MDS patients over a 13-year period in Friesland showed that multiple comorbidities, including previous malignancies, are associated with shorter OS. OS was not related to the use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The Swedish national guidelines for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) recommend analysis of measurable residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in bone marrow in the routine clinical setting. The Swedish AML registry contains such MRD data in AML patients diagnosed 2011-2019. Of 327 patients with AML (non-APL) with MRD-results reported in complete remission after two courses of intensive chemotherapy 229 were MRD-negative (70%), as defined by <0.1% cells with leukemia-associated immunophenotype in the bone marrow. MRD-results were reported to clinicians in real time. Multivariate statistical analysis adjusted for known established risk factors did not indicate an association between MFC-MRD and overall survival (HR: 1.00 [95% CI 0.61, 1.63]) with a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Knowledge of the importance of MRD status by clinicians and individualized decisions could have ameliorated the effects of MRD as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Autologous stem cell transplant (aHSCT) is associated with improved survival for multiple myeloma (MM) patients but may be associated with second primary malignancy (SPM) development. Using the California Cancer Registry linked to statewide hospitalization data, we determined the cumulative incidence (CMI) of SPMs more than 1 year after MM diagnosis, accounting for the competing risk of death. AHSCT recipients were matched 1:2 to non-aHSCT patients. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated using the Fine and Gray method. Among 16,331 patients, 933 (5.7%) developed a SPM more than 1 year after diagnosis. The 10-year CMI of developing any SPM was 6.6%, 5.7% for solid tumor SPM and 0.9% for hematologic malignancies. The 10-year CMI of developing any SPM was similar among aHSCT [9.1% (7.7-10.7%)] and non-aHSCT [7.5% (6.5-8.6%)] (P = 0.26) recipients and there was no difference in solid-tumor SPMs (P = 0.98). The 10-year CMI of hematologic SPMs was higher among aHSCT recipients [2.1% (1.4-2.9%) vs. 0.8% (0.5-1.2%); P = 0.005], corresponding to a 1.3% absolute increase and an aHR of 1.51 (1.01-2.27). Ten-year myeloma-specific and non-cancer mortality rates were 59% (58.2-60.0%) and 18.1% (17.4-18.8%), respectively. Although aHSCT was associated with a small increase in hematologic SPMs, mortality was driven by MM and non-cancer causes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Myelofibrosis (MF) belongs to the family of classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It can be primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or secondary myelofibrosis (SMF) evolving from polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the differences, PMF and SMF patients are currently managed in the same way, and prediction of survival is based on the same clinical and genetic features. In the last few years, interest has grown concerning the ability of gene expression profiles (GEPs) to provide valuable prognostic information. Here, we studied the GEPs of granulocytes from 114 patients with MF, using a microarray platform to identify correlations with patient characteristics and outcomes. Cox regression analysis led to the identification of 201 survival-related transcripts characterizing patients who are at high risk for death. High-risk patients identified by this gene signature displayed an inferior overall survival and leukemia-free survival, together with clinical and molecular detrimental features included in contemporary prognostic models, such as the presence of high molecular risk mutations. The high-risk group was enriched in post-PV and post-ET MF and JAK2V617F homozygous patients, whereas pre-PMF was more frequent in the low-risk group. These results demonstrate that GEPs in MF patients correlate with their molecular and clinical features, particularly their survival, and represent the proof of concept that GEPs might provide complementary prognostic information to be applied in clinical decision making.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Early results of the randomized placebo-controlled SORAML trial showed that, in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), sorafenib led to a significant improvement in event-free (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). In order to describe second-line treatments and their implications on overall survival (OS), we performed a study after a median follow-up time of 78 months. Newly diagnosed fit AML patients aged <=60 years received sorafenib (n = 134) or placebo (n = 133) in addition to standard chemotherapy and as maintenance treatment. The 5-year EFS was 41 versus 27% (HR 0.68; p = 0.011) and 5-year RFS was 53 versus 36% (HR 0.64; p = 0.035). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) was performed in 88% of the relapsed patients. Four years after salvage allo SCT, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 54 versus 35%, and OS was 32 versus 50%. The 5-year OS from randomization in all study patients was 61 versus 53% (HR 0.82; p = 0.282). In conclusion, the addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy led to a significant prolongation of EFS and RFS. Although the OS benefit did not reach statistical significance, these results confirm the antileukaemic activity of sorafenib.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has been investigated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received an immunomodulatory drug, proteasome inhibitor, and anti-CD38 antibody in the single-arm phase 2 KarMMa clinical trial. Two therapies with distinct mechanisms of action-selinexor plus dexamethasone (Sd) and belantamab mafodotin (BM)-are currently approved in the United States for heavily pretreated patients, including those who are triple-class refractory. To compare ide-cel versus Sd and ide-cel versus BM, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were performed. Ide-cel extended progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus both Sd and BM (hazard ratio (HR); 95% confidence interval (CI)). PFS: ide-cel versus Sd, 0.46; 0.28-0.75; ide-cel versus BM, 0.45; 0.27-0.77. OS: ide-cel versus Sd, 0.23; 0.13-0.42; ide-cel versus BM, 0.35; 0.14-0.87. These results suggest ide-cel offers clinically meaningful improvements over currently approved regimens for patients with heavily pretreated RRMM.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate risk cytogenetics (IRcyto) comprises a variety of biological entities with distinct mutational landscapes that translate into differential risks of relapse and prognosis. Optimal postremission therapy choice in this heterogeneous patient population is currently unsettled. In the current study, we compared outcomes in IRcyto AML recipients of autologous (autoSCT) (n = 312) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) (n = 279) in first complete remission (CR1). Molecular risk was defined based on CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-ITD mutational status, per European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria. Five-year overall survival (OS) in patients with favorable molecular risk (FRmol) was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-72) after autoSCT and 66% (95% CI, 41-83) after matched sibling donor (MSD) alloSCT (P = .68). For patients of intermediate molecular risk (IRmol), MSD alloSCT was associated with lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P < .001), as well as with increased nonrelapse mortality (P = .01), as compared to autoSCT. The 5-year OS was 47% (95% CI, 34-58) after autoSCT and 70% (95% CI, 59-79) after MSD alloSCT (P = .02) in this patient subgroup. In a propensity-score matched IRmol subcohort (n = 106), MSD alloSCT was associated with superior leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, P = .004) and increased OS in patients alive 1 year after transplantation (HR 0.20, P = .004). These results indicate that, within IRcyto AML in CR1, autoSCT may be a valid option for FRmol patients, whereas MSD alloSCT should be the preferred postremission strategy in IRmol patients.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have efficacy in lymphoid malignancies; however, inflammatory and infectious toxicities can compromise the treatment course. An improved understanding of these toxicities will guide clinical use and further development. We evaluated the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in a retrospective review of 79 patients treated in standard fashion with PI3K inhibitor monotherapy or with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or as part of a novel combination regimen. Patients treated with a novel combination were at a higher risk of developing a severe AE compared to those treated with standard therapy (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.02, 3.49; p =.04). Additionally, previously untreated patients were at higher risk of developing a severe AE compared to previously treated patients (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.48, 6.84; p =.003). These results caution against the use of untested PI3K inhibitor combinations in routine practice and suggest that early phase clinical trials should utilize conservative treatment schemas.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) has been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197 RRMM patients (pts) between January 2016 and March 2018 in six Italian hematologic centers, with the aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of KRd in real-life. At KRd initiation 27% carried high risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCA) [del17p and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (1-8), nearly all pts (96%) received prior bortezomib (18% refractory) while 45% were exposed to lenalidomide (R; 22% refractory). At the median of 12.5 months, 52% of the pts had discontinued treatment, mainly (66%) for progression. Main grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (21%), infections (11%), and hypertension (6%). Overall, the response rate was 88%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 19.8 months and 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.6%. By subgroup analysis, extended PFS and OS were observed for pts who received <=2 prior lines of therapy (HR = 0.42, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.35, p = 0.001, respectively), not refractory to prior R (HR = 0.37, p < 0.001, and HR = 0.47, p = 0.024), without HRCA (HR = 0.33, p = 0.005 and HR = 0.26, p = 0.016) and achieving >= very good partial response (VGPR; HR = 0.17, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.18, p < 0.001). In conclusion, KRd demonstrated to be effective in RRMM pts treated in real-world setting, without new safety concerns. Better survival outcomes emerged for pts with <=2 prior lines of therapy, achieving at least a VGPR, and without HRCA.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - In a series of 349 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we found lower levels of signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) expression in cases with highly complex karyotypes, as defined by the presence of five or more chromosomal abnormalities (CK5; P < 0.001) and with major chromosomal structural abnormalities (P < 0.001). SLAMF1 downregulation was significantly associated with advanced Binet Stage (P = 0.001), CD38 positivity (P < 0.001), high beta2-microglobulin levels (P < 0.001), immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV) unmutated status (P < 0.001), 11q deletion (P < 0.001), tumour protein p53 (TP53) disruption (P = 0.011) and higher risk CLL International Prognostic Index categories (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that downregulated SLAMF1 levels had independent negative prognostic impact on time-to-first treatment (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.001).Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations in AML are frequently found in patients with preexisting myeloid malignancies and are individually associated with poor outcomes. In this multi-institutional retrospective analysis, we assessed the genetic features and clinical outcomes of 43 patients with ASXL1mutSRSF2mut AML and compared outcomes to patients with either ASXL1 (n = 57) or SRSF2 (n = 70) mutations. Twenty-six (60%) had secondary-AML (s-AML). Variant allele fractions suggested that SRSF2 mutations preceded ASXL1 mutational events. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.0 months (95% CI:3.8,15.3) and was significantly longer in patients with de novo vs s-AML (15.3 vs 6.4 months, respectively; P =.04 on adjusted analysis). Compared to ASXL1mutSRSF2wt and ASXL1wtSRSF2mut, co-mutated patients had a 1.4 and 1.6 times increase in the probability of death, respectively (P =.049), with a trend towards inferior OS (median OS = 7.0 vs 11.5 vs 10.9 months, respectively; P =.10). Multivariable analysis suggests this difference in OS is attributable to the high proportion of s-AML patients in the co-mutated cohort (60% vs 32% and 23%, respectively). Although this study is limited by the retrospective data collection and the relatively small sample size, these data suggest that ASXL1mutSRSF2mut AML is a distinct subgroup of AML frequently associated with s-AML and differs from ASXL1mutSRSF2wt/ASXL1wtSRSF2mut with respect to etiology and leukemogenesis.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - In the phase 3 BOSTON study, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after 1-3 prior regimens were randomized to once-weekly selinexor (an oral inhibitor of exportin 1 [XPO1]) plus bortezomib-dexamethasone (XVd) or twice-weekly bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd). Compared with Vd, XVd was associated with significant improvements in median progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and lower rates of peripheral neuropathy, with trends in overall survival (OS) favoring XVd. In BOSTON, 141 (35.1%) patients had MM with high-risk (presence of del[17p], t[4;14], t[14;16], or >=4 copies of amp1q21) cytogenetics (XVd, n = 70; Vd, n = 71), and 261 (64.9%) exhibited standard-risk cytogenetics (XVd, n = 125; Vd, n = 136). Among patients with high-risk MM, median PFS was 12.91 months for XVd and 8.61 months for Vd (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, (0.4673, 1.1406)], p = 0.082), and ORRs were 78.6% and 57.7%, respectively (OR 2.68; p = 0.004). In the standard-risk subgroup, median PFS was 16.62 months for XVd and 9.46 months for Vd (HR 0.61; p = 0.004), and ORRs were 75.2% and 64.7%, respectively (OR 1.65; p = 0.033). The safety profiles of XVd and Vd in both subgroups were consistent with the overall population. These data suggest that selinexor can confer benefits to patients with MM regardless of cytogenetic risk. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03110562.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Despite high complete remission (CR) rates with frontline therapy, relapses are frequent in adults with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with limited salvage options. We analyzed the outcomes and prognostic factors for CR to salvage therapy and overall survival (OS) of patients with R/R T-ALL included in two prospective measurable residual disease-oriented trials. Seventy-five patients (70 relapsed, 5 refractory) were identified. Relapses occurred in bone marrow, isolated or combined in 50 patients, and in the central nervous system (CNS; isolated or combined) in 20. Second CR was attained in 30/75 patients (40%). Treatment with FLAG-Ida and isolated CNS relapse were independently associated with a higher CR rate after first salvage therapy. The median OS was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-8.6) months, with a 4-year OS probability of 18% (95% CI, 9%-27%). No differences in survival were observed according to the treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients in CR after first salvage therapy. Multivariable analysis showed a >=12-month interval between first CR and relapse, CR after first salvage therapy and isolated CNS relapse as favorable prognostic factors for OS with hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of 1.931 (1.109-3.362), 2.958 (1.640-5.334), and 2.976 (1.157-7.655), respectively. This study confirms the poor outcomes of adults with R/R T-ALL among whom FLAG-Ida was the best of the rescue therapies evaluated. Late relapse, CR after first rescue therapy and isolated CNS relapse showed prognostic impact on survival. More effective rescue therapies are needed in adults with R/R T-ALL.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - The need for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with high-risk (HR) features and adequate measurable residual disease (MRD) clearance remains unclear. The aim of the ALL-HR-11 trial was to evaluate the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients following chemotherapy or allo-HSCT administered based on end-induction and consolidation MRD levels. Patients aged 15 to 60 years with HR-ALL in complete response (CR) and MRD levels (centrally assessed by 8-color flow cytometry) <0.1% after induction and <0.01% after early consolidation were assigned to receive delayed consolidation and maintenance therapy up to 2 years in CR. The remaining patients were allocated to allo-HSCT. CR was attained in 315/348 patients (91%), with MRD <0.1% after induction in 220/289 patients (76%). By intention-to-treat, 218 patients were assigned to chemotherapy and 106 to allo-HSCT. The 5-year (+/-95% confidence interval) cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival probabilities for the whole series were 43% +/- 7%, 49% +/- 7%, and 40% +/- 6%, respectively, with CIR and OS rates of 45% +/- 8% and 59% +/- 9% for patients assigned to chemotherapy and of 40% +/- 12% and 38% +/- 11% for those assigned to allo-HSCT, respectively. Our results show that avoiding allo-HSCT does not hamper the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients up to 60 years with adequate MRD response after induction and consolidation. Better postremission alternative therapies are especially needed for patients with poor MRD clearance. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT01540812.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Germline pathogenic TERT variants are associated with short telomeres and an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) among patients with a telomere biology disorder. We identified TERT rare variants in 41 of 1514 MDS patients (2.7%) without a clinical diagnosis of a telomere biology disorder who underwent allogeneic transplantation. Patients with a TERT rare variant had shorter telomere length (P < .001) and younger age at MDS diagnosis (52 vs 59 years, P = .03) than patients without a TERT rare variant. In multivariable models, TERT rare variants were associated with inferior overall survival (P = .034) driven by an increased incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM; P = .015). Death from a noninfectious pulmonary cause was more frequent among patients with a TERT rare variant. Most variants were missense substitutions and classified as variants of unknown significance. Therefore, we cloned all rare missense variants and quantified their impact on telomere elongation in a cell-based assay. We found that 90% of TERT rare variants had severe or intermediate impairment in their capacity to elongate telomeres. Using a homology model of human TERT bound to the shelterin protein TPP1, we inferred that TERT rare variants disrupt domain-specific functions, including catalysis, protein-RNA interactions, and recruitment to telomeres. Our results indicate that the contribution of TERT rare variants to MDS pathogenesis and NRM risk is underrecognized. Routine screening for TERT rare variants in MDS patients regardless of age or clinical suspicion may identify clinically inapparent telomere biology disorders and improve transplant outcomes through risk-adapted approaches.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - In 2019 the UK Myeloma Research Alliance introduced the Myeloma Risk Profile (MRP) for prediction of outcome in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. To validate the MRP in a population-based setting we performed a study of the entire cohort of transplant ineligible MM patients above 65 years in the Danish National MM Registry. Our data confirmed the value of the MRP. In a cohort of 1,377 patients, the MRP score separated patients into three distinct risk-groups with an observed hazard ratio of 2.91 for early death in high-risk versus low-risk patients.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - To investigate the efficacy and toxicities of CPX-351 outside a clinical trial, we analyzed 188 patients (median age 65 years, range 26-80) treated for therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML, 29%) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC, 70%). Eighty-six percent received one, 14% two induction cycles, and 10% received consolidation (representing 22% of patients with CR/CRi) with CPX-351. Following induction, CR/CRi rate was 47% including 64% of patients with available information achieving measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity (<10-3) as measured by flow cytometry. After a median follow-up of 9.3 months, median overall survival (OS) was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 64%. In multivariate analysis, complex karyotype predicted lower response (p = 0.0001), while pretreatment with hypomethylating agents (p = 0.02) and adverse European LeukemiaNet 2017 genetic risk (p < 0.0001) were associated with lower OS. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) was performed in 116 patients (62%) resulting in promising outcome (median survival not reached, 1-year OS 73%), especially in MRD-negative patients (p = 0.048). With 69% of patients developing grade III/IV non-hematologic toxicity following induction and a day 30-mortality of 8% the safety profile was consistent with previous findings. These real-world data confirm CPX-351 as efficient treatment for these high-risk AML patients facilitating allo-HCT in many patients with promising outcome after transplantation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk (HR) B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients with end of induction (EOI) minimal residual disease (MRD) >=0.1% and end of consolidation (EOC) MRD >=0.01% is 39 +/- 7%, warranting consideration of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, the impact of EOC MRD in NCI standard-risk (SR) B-ALL patients using COG regimens is unknown. We found that SR patients with MRD >=0.01% at both EOI and EOC have a 4-year DFS/overall survival (OS) of 72.9 +/- 19.0%/91.7 +/- 10.8% versus 90.7 +/- 2.9%/95.5 +/- 2.0% (p =.0019/.25) for those with EOI MRD >=0.01% and EOC MRD <0.01%. These data suggest that routine use of HSCT may not be warranted in EOC MRD >=0.01% SR patients.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess differences in efficacy and tolerability between a busulfan AUC target of 16.4 mg x Hr/L per day (FluBu4K) and a conventional RIC regimen (FluBu2). Adult patients with a diagnosis of AML or MDS who received fludarabine + busulfan conditioning with or without antithymocyte globulin between 2015 and 2018 were included. The primary outcome was relapse free survival. Overall, 74 patients received conditioning with either FluBu4K or FluBu2. At 18 months, relapse-free survival was not significantly different, at 63.9% with FluBu4k compared to 57.5% with FluBu2 (p = 0.49). There was a statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse at 18 months in favor of the FluBu4K regimen, at 12.0% vs 32.5% (p = 0.047). The results of this study indicate that for select patients, there may be benefit in choosing targeted FluBu4K over FluBu2. Adverse effects other than mucositis were not significantly different.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Natural killer (NK) cell determinants predict relapse-free survival after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia, and previous studies have shown a beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect in patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). However, whether NK cell determinants predict protection against relapse for JMML patients undergoing HCT is unknown. Therefore, we investigated NK cell-related donor and recipient immunogenetics as determinants of HCT outcomes in patients with JMML. Patients with JMML (age 0 to <19 years) who underwent a first allogeneic HCT from an unrelated donor between 2000 and 2017 and had available donor samples from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Repository were included. Donor killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) typing was performed on pre-HCT samples. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included relapse, grade II-IV acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), GVHD-free relapse-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, and overall survival (OS). Donor KIR models tested included KIR genotype (AA versus Bx), B content (0-1 versus >=2), centromeric and telomeric region score (AA versus AB versus BB), B content score (best, better, or neutral), composite score (2 versus 3 versus 4), activating KIR content, and the presence of KIR2DS4. Ligand-ligand and KIR-ligand mismatch effects on outcomes were analyzed in HLA-mismatched donors (<=7/8; n = 74) only. Univariate analyses were performed for primary and secondary outcomes of interest, with a P value <.05 considered significant. One hundred sixty-five patients (113 males), with a median follow-up of 85 months (range, 6 to 216 months) met the study criteria. Of these, 111 underwent an unrelated donor HCT and 54 underwent a UCB HCT. Almost all (n = 161; 98%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. After exclusion of recipients of reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens and ex vivo T cell-depleted grafts (n = 8), there were 42 AA donors and 115 Bx donors, respectively. Three-year DFS, OS, relapse, and GRFS for the entire cohort were 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 66%), 67% (95% CI, 59% to 74%), 26% (95% CI, 19% to 33%), and 27% (95% CI, 19% to 35%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD at 100 days was 36% (95% CI, 27% to 44%), and that of cGVHD at 1 year was 23% (95% CI, 17% to 30%). There were no differences between AA donors and Bx donors for any recipient survival outcomes. The risk of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in patients with donors with a B content score of >=2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.83; P = .01), an activating KIR content score of >3 (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.95; P = .032), centromeric A/B score (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 033 to 0.98; P = .041), and telomeric A/B score (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.00; P = .048). To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the association of NK cell determinants and outcomes in JMML HCT recipients. This study identifies potential benefits of donor KIR-B genotypes in reducing aGVHD. Our findings warrant further study of the role of NK cells in enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect via recognition of JMML blasts.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Options for anemic lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without del(5q) after failure of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are very limited. The effectiveness of second-line treatments is uncertain. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical effectiveness and overall survival (OS) of lower-risk MDS without del(5q) patients exclusively treated with stanozolol (STZ) after failure of epoetin alfa. The response was defined according to the 2006 International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Fifty-six patients were included. The median follow-up time was 55 months (range: 5-156 months). Twenty-seven patients (48.2%) achieved hematologic improvement-erythroid response (HI-E). Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower IPSS-R scores (<=3.5, P = 0.008) and hypocellular bone marrow (P = 0.002). In univariate Cox analysis, HI-E was the strongest factor associated with better OS (P = 0.0003). In multivariate Cox, HI-E, age <= 50, and transfusion independence (TI) at the onset of STZ were factors associated with better OS. The estimated 5-year OS was 88.6% (68.7-96.2%) and 33.8% (14.9-54.0%) in responders and non-responders (P < 0.01), respectively. The most common side effects included masculinization and liver damage, but they were manageable with supportive measures and dose adjustments. STZ may be considered an alternative treatment in lower-risk MDS after failure of epoetin alfa.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Severe bleeding is a major cause of death in acute leukemia (AL) patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogene hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, the prognostic value and prediction of HSCT-associated severe bleeding in GVHD patients have not been reported in cohort studies. We did a retrospective analysis of 200 AL patients with GVHD after allo-HSCT from Feb 1, 2014, to Dec 1, 2015. Multivariate analysis showed that the severe bleeding class was associated with the risk of death (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.31-3.92, p<0.001***). In order to predict severe bleeding and figure out the solution to bleeding events, we established a multiple logistic regression model. HLA-DQB1 unmatching, megakaryocyte reconsititution failure, and III or IV GVHD were the independent risk factors for severe bleeding. Among all the variations above, OR of HLA-DQB1 was the highest (OR: 16.02, 95% CI: 11.54-48.68). Adding HLA-DQB1 to other factors improved the reclassification for predicting severe bleeding (NRI=0.195, z=2.634, p=0.008**; IDI=0.289, z=3.249, p<0.001***). Lasso regression was used to select variants. A nomogram of the logistic model was generated and displayed. Calibration curve demonstrated excellent accuracy in estimating severe bleeding (C index of 0.935). HLA-DQB1 showed excellent efficacy of predicting severe bleeding in HSCT patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Although case-control analyses have suggested an additive value with the association of clarithromycin to continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), there are not phase III trials confirming these results. In this phase III trial, 286 patients with MM ineligible for ASCT received Rd with or without clarithromycin until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). With a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 0-54), no significant differences in the median PFS were observed between the two arms (C-Rd 23 months, Rd 29 months; HR 0.783, p = 0.14), despite a higher rate of complete response (CR) or better in the C-Rd group (22.6% vs 14.4%, p = 0.048). The most common G3-4 adverse events were neutropenia [12% vs 19%] and infections [30% vs 25%], similar between the two arms; however, the percentage of toxic deaths was higher in the C-Rd group (36/50 [72%] vs 22/40 [55%], p = 0.09). The addition of clarithromycin to Rd in untreated transplant ineligible MM patients does not improve PFS despite increasing the >=CR rate due to the higher number of toxic deaths in the C-Rd arm. Side effects related to overexposure to steroids due to its delayed clearance induced by clarithromycin in this elderly population could explain these results. The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov with the name GEM-CLARIDEX: Ld vs BiRd and with the following identifier NCT02575144. The full trial protocol can be accessed from ClinicalTrials.gov. This study received financial support from BMS/Celgene.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), flow cytometry (FCM) detects leukemic cells in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) more accurately than conventional cytology (CC). However, the clinical significance of FCM positivity with a negative cytology (i.e., occult central nervous system [CNS] disease) is not clear. In the framework of the national Campus ALL program, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of occult CNS disease and its impact on outcome in 240 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL. All CSF samples were investigated by CC and FCM. The presence of >=10 phenotypically abnormal events, forming a cluster, was considered to be FCM positivity. No CNS involvement was documented in 179 patients, while 18 were positive by modified conventional morphology with CC and 43 were occult CNS disease positive. The relapse rate was significantly lower in CNS disease negative patients and the disease-free and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer in CNS disease negative patients than in those with manifest or occult CNS disease positivity. In multivariate analysis, the status of manifest and occult CNS disease positivity was independently associated with a worse OS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in adult ALL patients at diagnosis FCM can detect occult CNS disease at high sensitivity and that the status of occult CNS disease positivity is associated with an adverse outcome.

N2  - Leukemic cells display some alterations in metabolic pathways, which play a role in leukemogenesis and in patients' prognosis. To evaluate the characteristics and the impact of this metabolic reprogramming, we explore the bone marrow samples from 54 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on proton high-resolution magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance. The spectra obtained were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis to find specific metabolome alterations and biomarkers correlated to clinical features. We found that patients display a large diversity of metabolic profiles, according to the different AML cytologic subtypes and molecular statuses. The link between metabolism and molecular status was particularly strong for the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), whose intracellular production is directly linked to the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations. Moreover, patients' prognosis was strongly impacted by several metabolites, such as 2-HG that appeared as a good prognostic biomarker in our cohort. Conversely, deregulations in phospholipid metabolism had a negative impact on prognosis through 2 main metabolites (phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine), which could be potential aggressiveness biomarkers. Finally, we highlighted an overexpression of glutathione and alanine in chemoresistant patients. Overall, our results demonstrate that different metabolic pathways could be activated in leukemic cells according to their phenotype and maturation levels. This confirms that metabolic reprogramming strongly influences prognosis of patients and underscores a particular role of certain metabolites and associated pathways in AML prognosis, suggesting common mechanisms developed by leukemic cells to maintain their aggressiveness even after well-conducted induction chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Venetoclax is efficacious in relapsed/refractory t(11;14) multiple myeloma, thus warranting investigation in light-chain amyloidosis (AL). This retrospective cohort includes 43 patients with previously treated AL, from 14 centers in the US and Europe. Thirty-one patients harbored t(11;14), 11 did not, and one t(11;14) status was unknown. Patients received a venetoclax-containing regimen for at least one 21- or 28-day cycle; the median prior treatments was three. The hematologic response rate for all patients was 68%; 63% achieved VGPR/CR. t(11;14) patients had higher hematologic response (81% vs. 40%) and higher VGPR/CR rate (78% vs. 30%, odds ratio: 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.62) than non-t(11;14) patients. For the unsegregated cohort, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 31.0 months and median OS was not reached (NR). For t(11;14), median PFS was NR and for non-t(11;14) median PFS was 6.7 months (HR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.53). Multivariate analysis incorporating age, sex, prior lines of therapy, and disease stage suggested a risk reduction for progression or death in t(11;14) patients. Median OS was NR for either subgroup. The organ response rate was 38%; most responders harbored t(11;14). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 19% with 7% due to infections. These promising results require confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The introduction of agents inhibiting the B-cell receptor-associated kinases such as ibrutinib has dramatically changed treatments algorithms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as the role of different adverse prognosticators. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib as a single agent, in a real-life context, in 180 patients with CLL mostly pretreated, recruited from three independent cohorts from Italy. Patients received 420 mg oral ibrutinib once daily until progression or occurrence of unacceptable side effects. Seventy-three patients discontinued ibrutinib for progression or for adverse events. NOTCH1 mutations (NOTCH1 M) were correlated with a reduced redistribution lymphocytosis, calculated at 3 months on ibrutinib (P=0.022). Moreover, NOTCH1 M patients showed inferior nodal response at 6 months on ibrutinib compared to NOTCH1 wild-type patients (P<0.0001). Significant shorter progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed in NOTCH1 M patients (P=0.00002 and P=0.001). Interestingly, NOTCH1 M plus a lower BAX/BCL-2 ratio identified a CLL subset showing the worst PFS and OS (P=0.0002 and P=0.005). In multivariate analysis of PFS and OS, NOTCH1 M were confirmed an independent prognosticator (P=0.00006 and P=0.0039). In conclusion, NOTCH1 M are strongly associated with a lower BAX/BCL-2 ratio, consistent with defective apoptosis, lower redistribution lymphocytosis and lower nodal shrinkage under ibrutinib treatment, this last paramter being responsible for partial responses, subsequent relapses, as well as shorter PFS and OS. Either new small molecule combination approaches or antibodies targeting NOTCH1 could be future therapeutic options for NOTCH1 M patients.Copyright ©2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Background: Approval of hypomethylating agents in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is based on trials done in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We aimed to investigate whether hypomethylating agents provide a benefit in subgroups of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia compared with other treatments. Method(s): For this retrospective cohort study, data were retrieved between Nov 30, 2017, and Jan 5, 2019, from 38 centres in the USA and Europe. We included non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, who received chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-directed therapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia according to 2016 WHO criteria at initial diagnosis (ie, >=20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood) or with unavailability of treatment data were excluded. Outcomes assessed included overall survival, time to next treatment, and time to transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, platelet count, and Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-Specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS). Patients were grouped by first received treatment with either hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents, or intensive chemotherapy, and stratified by risk according to blast count, French-American-British subtype, CPSS, WHO 2016 subtype, and the eligibility criteria of the DACOTA trial (NCT02214407). Finding(s): 949 patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia between April 13, 1981, and Oct 26, 2018, were included. Median follow-up was 23.4 months (IQR 11.5-42.3) from diagnosis and 16.2 months (6.6-31.6) from start of first-line treatment. 412 (43%) of 949 patients received hypomethylating agents as first treatment, 391 (41%) hydroxyurea, and 83 (9%) intensive chemotherapy. Adjusted median overall survival for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents was 15.6 months (95% CI 13.1-17.3) versus 20.7 months (17.9-23.4); hazard ratio (HR) 1.39 (1.17-1.65; p=0.0002) and 14.0 months (9.8-17.2) versus 20.7 months (17.9-23.4; HR 1.55 [1.16-2.05]; p=0.0027) for those treated with intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. In patients with myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (myeloproliferative CMML), median overall survival was 12.6 months (10.7-15.0) versus 17.6 months (14.8-21.5; HR 1.38 [1.12-1.70]; p=0.0027) for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents, and 12.3 months (8.4-16.6) versus 17.6 months (14.8-21.5; HR 1.44 [1.02-2.03]; p=0.040) for intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. Hypomethylating agents did not confer an overall survival advantage for patients classified as having lower-risk disease (ie, myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with <10% blasts, CMML-0, or lower-risk CPSS). Interpretation(s): These data suggest hypomethylating agents as the preferred therapy for patients with higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and those with myeloproliferative CMML. Our findings also suggest that CPSS is a valuable tool to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from hypomethylating agents. Further evidence from prospective cohorts would be desirable.

N2  - Background: Safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are unknown in hematological patients; both were evaluated prospectively in 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 50 with myeloproliferative malignancies (MPM) (20 chronic myeloid leukemias and 30 myeloproliferative neoplasms), all of them on active anti-cancer treatment, in comparison with 36 elderly controls not suffering from cancer. Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. Method(s): Titration was done using LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher' exact test and the Mann-Whitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively. Result(s): At 5 weeks, GMC of IgG in elderly controls was 353.3 AU/mL versus 106.7 in MM (p = 0.003) and 172.9 in MPM patients (p = 0.049). Seroprotection rate at cutoff of 15 AU/mL was 100% in controls compared to 78.6% in MM (p = 0.003) and 88% in MPM patients (p = 0.038). In terms of logarithm of IgG titer, in a generalized multivariate linear model, no gender effect was observed (p = 0.913), while there was a significant trend toward lower titers by increasing age (p < 0.001) and in disease cohorts with respect to controls (MM: p < 0.001 and MPM: p < 0.001). An ongoing treatment without daratumumab was associated with higher likelihood of response in MM patients (p = 0.003). No swabs resulted positive on each time point. No safety concerns were observed. Conclusion(s): BNT162b2 has demonstrated to be immunogenic at different extent among the cohorts. Response was 88% and robust in MPM patients. MM patients responded significantly less, particularly those on anti-CD38-based treatment. These latter patients should be advised to maintain masks and social distancing regardless of vaccination status, and their cohabiting family members need to be vaccinated in order to reduce the risk of contagion from the family. Additional boosters and titer monitoring could be considered. Trial registration Study was formally approved by the IRCCS Central Ethical Committee of Regione Lazio in January 2021 (Prot. N-1463/21).Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Patients diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), particularly if recently treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, are at risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Because studies evaluating humoral response to COVID-19 vaccine in these patients are lacking, recommendations regarding vaccination strategy remain unclear. The humoral immune response to BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated in patients with B-NHL who received 2 vaccine doses 21 days apart and compared with the response in healthy controls. Antibody titer, measured by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2S assay, was evaluated 2 to 3 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Patients with B-NHL (n 5 149), aggressive B-NHL (a-B-NHL; 47%), or indolent B-NHL (i-B-NHL; 53%) were evaluated. Twenty-eight (19%) were treatment naive, 37% were actively treated with a rituximab/ obinutuzumab (R/Obi) based induction regimen or R/Obi maintenance, and 44% had last been treated with R/Obi .6 months before vaccination. A seropositive response was achieved in 89%, 7.3%, and 66.7%, respectively, with response rates of 49% in patients with B-NHL vs 98.5% in 65 healthy controls (P , .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that longer time since exposure to R/Obi and absolute lymphocyte count $0.9 3 103/mL predicted a positive serological response. Median time to achieve positive serology among anti-CD20 antibody-Treated patients was longer in i-B-NHL vs a-B-NHL. The humoral response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is impaired in patients with B-NHL who are undergoing R/Obi treatment. Longer time since exposure to R/Obi is associated with improved response rates to the COVID-19 vaccine. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04746092.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients often undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in first complete remission (CR). We examined the effect of depth of clinical response, including incomplete count recovery (CRi) and/or measurable residual disease (MRD), in patients from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) registry. We identified 2492 adult patients (1799 CR and 693 CRi) who underwent alloHCT between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors. Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients in CRi compared to those in CR had an increased likelihood of death (HR: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.43). Compared to CR, CRi was significantly associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM), shorter disease-free survival (DFS), and a trend toward increased relapse. Detectable MRD was associated with shorter OS, shorter DFS, higher NRM, and increased relapse compared to absence of MRD. The deleterious effects of CRi and MRD were independent. In this large CIBMTR cohort, survival outcomes differ among AML patients based on depth of CR and presence of MRD at the time of alloHCT. Further studies should focus on optimizing post-alloHCT outcomes for patients with responses less than CR.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - There are conflicting data about whether the development of cancer-associated thrombo-embolism (TE) negatively impacts survival in children. The objective was to determine whether TE during treatment was associated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Cancer in Young People-Canada registry. Children <15 years of age were diagnosed with de novo ALL (2000-2016). The primary exposure variable was radiologically-confirmed thrombo-embolism requiring medical intervention. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to determine the impact of thrombo-embolism on survival, where TE was time-dependent. We included 2006 children (median age: 4 years, 88.5% precursor B-cell ALL). Thrombo-embolism occurred in 113 patients (5.6%), at a median time of 107 days (interquartile range: 35-184 days) after ALL diagnosis. Among standard/low-risk patients, 41/1165 (3.5%) developed TE while among high/very high-risk patients, 72/841 (8.6%) developed TE. Patients with TE had a significantly worse OS (adjusted HR [aHR] of death: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.62-4.22, p < 0.001) and EFS (aHR of an event [death, relapse, second malignancy]: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.35-3.05, p = 0.001), compared with patients without TE. No statistically significant difference was seen in standard/low risk ALL for OS and EFS, but TE was associated with a significantly lower OS and EFS in children with high/very high-risk ALL (aHR of death: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.79-4.72, p < 0.001; aHR of an event: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.30-3.12, p = 0.002). Thus, TE led to a statistically significant reduction in OS and EFS in children with high risk/very high-risk leukemia.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - We aimed to study the prognostic impact of the mutational landscape in primary and secondary myelofibrosis. The study included 479 patients with myelofibrosis recruited from 24 French Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM) centers. The molecular landscape was studied by high-throughput sequencing of 77 genes. A Bayesian network allowed the identification of genomic groups whose prognostic impact was studied in a multistate model considering transitions from the 3 conditions: Myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, and death. Results were validated using an independent, previously published cohort (n 5 276). Four genomic groups were identified: Patients with TP53 mutation; patients with $1 mutation in EZH2, CBL, U2AF1, SRSF2, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, or KRAS (highrisk group); patients with ASXL1-only mutation (ie, no associated mutation in TP53 or highrisk genes); and other patients. A multistate model found that both TP53 and high-risk groups were associated with leukemic transformation (hazard ratios [HRs] [95% confidence interval], 8.68 [3.32-22.73] and 3.24 [1.58-6.64], respectively) and death from myelofibrosis (HRs, 3.03 [1.66-5.56] and 1.77 [1.18-2.67], respectively). ASXL1-only mutations had no prognostic value that was confirmed in the validation cohort. However, ASXL1 mutations conferred a worse prognosis when associated with a mutation in TP53 or high-risk genes. This study provides a new definition of adverse mutations in myelofibrosis with the addition of TP53, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, and U2AF1 to previously described genes. Furthermore, our results argue that ASXL1 mutations alone cannot be considered detrimental.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The association of Cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has increased in the setting of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Nevertheless, the use of CsA or CsA+MMF has not been reported in a large and uniform cohort. We analyzed 497 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission (CR) who underwent matched unrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). All patients received a fludarabine busulfan RIC regimen and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) with either CsA alone or in combination with MMF. The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-IV acute GvHD was 27% (95% CI 21-33%) for CsA and 33% (95% CI 27-38%) for CsA+MMF (p = 0.25). The 2-year CI of chronic GvHD was 38% (95% CI 31-45%) and 33% (95% CI 28-39%) for the CsA and the CsA+MMF group, respectively (p = 0.26). On multivariate analysis, no statistically significant differences with respect to relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), acute and chronic GvHD were found between the two groups, also when conducting a subgroup analysis in peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) recipients. Our results support the importance of randomized trial to identify patients who could benefit from the addition of MMF in MUD HSCT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - COVID-19 is associated with high mortality in patients with haematological malignancies (HM) and rate of seroconversion is unknown. The ITA-HEMA-COV project (NCT04352556) investigated patterns of seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with HMs. A total of 237 patients, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive with at least one SARS-CoV-2 IgG test performed during their care, entered the analysis. Among these, 62 (26.2%) had myeloid, 121 (51.1%) lymphoid and 54 (22.8%) plasma cell neoplasms. Overall, 69% of patients (164 of 237) had detectable IgG SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Serologically negative patients (31%, 73 of 237) were evenly distributed across patients with myeloid, lymphoid and plasma cell neoplasms. In the multivariable logistic regression, chemoimmunotherapy [odds ratio (OR), 3.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-11.21; P = 0.04] was associated with a lower rate of seroconversion. This effect did not decline after 180 days from treatment withdrawal (OR, 0.35; 95% CI: 0.11-1.13; P = 0.08). This study demonstrates a low rate of seroconversion in HM patients and indicates that treatment-mediated immune dysfunction is the main driver. As a consequence, we expect a low rate of seroconversion after vaccination and thus we suggest testing the efficacy of seroconversion in HM patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.British Journal of Haematology published by British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can offer cure to some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It remains unclear how conditioning intensity affects transplant outcomes in ALL. In this retrospective study, we compared outcomes between 27 patients <60 who received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) at Princess Margaret Hospital Cancer Center (PMCC) and 226 Cell Therapy Transplant Canada (CTTC) age-matched controls who received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) between 2007 and 2018. Compared to CTTC patients, PMCC patients had an inferior 2-y OS: 0.29 (95% CI: 0.11-0.49) vs 0.63 (0.56-0.70), HR = 2.10 (1.23-3.55), p = 0.006, higher TRM: 0.41 (0.22-0.60) vs 0.24 (0.18-0.30), HR = 2.00 (1.05-3.81), p = 0.04 and a trend toward increased risk of relapse: 0.36 (0.17-0.56) versus 0.17 (0.12-0.22), HR = 1.72 (0.82-3.62), p = 0.15. In multivariate analysis, RIC and the use of T-cell depletion (TCD) were associated with inferior OS. In ALL patients <60, the use of RIC with TCD is associated with inferior allogeneic HCT outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is associated with immunosuppression and patients are at increased clinical risk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Covid-19 vaccines offer the potential for protection against severe infection but relatively little is known regarding the profile of the antibody response following first or second vaccination. We studied spike-specific antibody responses following first and/or second Covid-19 vaccination in 299 patients with CLL compared with healthy donors. 286 patients underwent extended interval (10-12 week) vaccination. 154 patients received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and 145 patients received ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken either by venepuncture or as dried blood spots on filter paper. Spike-specific antibody responses were detectable in 34% of patients with CLL after one vaccine (n = 267) compared to 94% in healthy donors with antibody titres 104-fold lower in the patient group. Antibody responses increased to 75% after second vaccine (n = 55), compared to 100% in healthy donors, although titres remained lower. Multivariate analysis showed that current treatment with BTK inhibitors or IgA deficiency were independently associated with failure to generate an antibody response after the second vaccine. This work supports the need for optimisation of vaccination strategy in patients with CLL including the potential utility of booster vaccines.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Real-world outcomes of daratumumab monotherapy (DM) for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) have remained unclear. We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of 107 patients receiving DM for RRMM. The cohort included 64 trial-unfit patients whose characteristics could not meet inclusion criteria in two previous clinical trials (GEN501 and SIRIUS). The overall response rate (ORR), and median first and second progression-free survival (PFS1 and PFS2) and overall survival were 42.1%, and 3.6, 8.1 and 11.9 months, respectively. Refractoriness to carfilzomib and/or lenalidomide, and neutropenia (<1.0 x 109/l) resulted in poorer ORRs. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of >=3, neutropenia (<1.0 x 109/l), thrombocytopenia (<75 x 109/l), and renal failure (glomerular filtration rate of <20 ml/min/1.73 m2) were associated with poor PFS1 and PFS2 in respective univariate analysis. The modified trial-unfit group, based on the above factors, showed significantly negative impacts on PFS1 and PFS2 (hazard ratio 2.823 and 3.677, all P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis despite having a 34% ORR. Fatal infections occurred more often in the modified trial-unfit group than in the others (16.1% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.099). Despite failure of DM, subsequent therapy with pomalidomide-based therapy or carfilzomib-dexamethasone provided a 66.6% ORR. Real-world DM showed favourable efficacies for RRMM and, potentially, additional benefits with subsequent therapies. However, characteristics corresponding with trial-unfitness might offset the efficacy of DM.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The utility of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia-international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) in predicting outcomes of individuals with Rai 0 stage CLL and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is unclear. We identified 969 individuals (415 MBL and 554 Rai 0 CLL; median age, 64 years; 65% men) seen at Mayo Clinic between 1 January 2001 and 1 October 2018, and ascertained time to first therapy (TTFT) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow up of 7 years, the risk of disease progression needing therapy was 2.9%/y for MBL (median, not reached) and 5%/y for Rai 0 CLL (median, 10.4 years). Among patients with low, intermediate, and high/very high-risk CLL-IPI risk groups, the estimated 5-year risk of TTFT was 13.5%, 30%, and 58%, respectively, P < .0001 (c-statistic = 0.69); and the estimated 5-year OS was 96.3%, 91.5%, and 76%, respectively, P < .0001 (c-statistic = 0.65). In a multivariable analysis of absolute B-cell count with individual factors of the CLL-IPI, the absolute B-cell count was associated with shorter TTFT (hazard ratio [HR] for each 10 x 109/L increase: 1.31; P < .0001) and shorter OS (HR: 1.1; P = .02). The OS of the entire cohort was similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general population of Minnesota (P = .17), although Rai 0 CLL patients with high and very high-risk CLL-IPI score had significantly shorter OS (P = .01 and P = .0001, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate the ability of CLL-IPI to predict time from diagnosis to first treatment (an end point not affected by therapy) in a large cohort of patients whose only manifestation of disease is a circulating clonal lymphocyte population.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rare in young patients (age <40 years at diagnosis), with a prevalence of <0.3%, representing ~2% of all patients with MGUS. We hypothesized that MGUS detected in young patients may be associated with a higher risk of progression. We examined 249 patients with MGUS < 40 years old. Among these, 135 patients had immune-related conditions, including infections, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders at the time of diagnosis of MGUS. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma or a related disorder at 5 years and 10 years was 6.0% and 13.8%, respectively. The size of M protein was a significant risk factor for progression (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-7.9). There was a trend that the risk of progression was higher in patients without immune-related conditions (HR 2.36, 95% CI 0.85-6.52, p = 0.088). The M protein resolved in 36 (14%) patients, with a greater likelihood of resolution in patients with immune-related conditions (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.6). Young patients with MGUS have a similar risk of progression as older patients, 1.4% per year. Over 50% are diagnosed in the setting of immune-related disorders. Patients with immune-related disorders may have a lower risk of progression.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The role of decentralized assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) for risk stratification in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely unknown, and so it does which methodological aspects are critical to empower the evaluation of MRD with prognostic significance, particularly if using multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). We analyzed 1076 AML patients in first remission after induction chemotherapy, in whom MRD was evaluated by MFC in local laboratories of 60 Hospitals participating in the PETHEMA registry. We also conducted a survey on technical aspects of MRD testing to determine the impact of methodological heterogeneity in the prognostic value of MFC. Our results confirmed the recommended cutoff of 0.1% to discriminate patients with significantly different cumulative-incidence of relapse (-CIR- HR:0.71, P < 0.001) and overall survival (HR: 0.73, P = 0.001), but uncovered the limited prognostic value of MFC based MRD in multivariate and recursive partitioning models including other clinical, genetic and treatment related factors. Virtually all aspects related with methodological, interpretation, and reporting of MFC based MRD testing impacted in its ability to discriminate patients with different CIR. Thus, this study demonstrated that "real-world" assessment of MRD using MFC is prognostic in patients at first remission, and urges greater standardization for improved risk-stratification toward clinical decisions in AML.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Patients with hematological malignancies (HM) are at high risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A better understanding of risk factors for adverse outcomes may improve clinical management in these patients. We therefore studied baseline characteristics of HM patients developing COVID-19 and analyzed predictors of mortality. Method(s): The survey was supported by the Scientific Working Group Infection in Hematology of the European Hematology Association (EHA). Eligible for the analysis were adult patients with HM and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 observed between March and December 2020. Result(s): The study sample includes 3801 cases, represented by lymphoproliferative (mainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 1084, myeloma n = 684 and chronic lymphoid leukemia n = 474) and myeloproliferative malignancies (mainly acute myeloid leukemia n = 497 and myelodysplastic syndromes n = 279). Severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in 63.8% of patients (n = 2425). Overall, 2778 (73.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 689 (18.1%) of whom were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, 1185 patients (31.2%) died. The primary cause of death was COVID-19 in 688 patients (58.1%), HM in 173 patients (14.6%), and a combination of both COVID-19 and progressing HM in 155 patients (13.1%). Highest mortality was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (199/497, 40%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (118/279, 42.3%). The mortality rate significantly decreased between the first COVID-19 wave (March-May 2020) and the second wave (October-December 2020) (581/1427, 40.7% vs. 439/1773, 24.8%, p value < 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis, age, active malignancy, chronic cardiac disease, liver disease, renal impairment, smoking history, and ICU stay correlated with mortality. Acute myeloid leukemia was a higher mortality risk than lymphoproliferative diseases. Conclusion(s): This survey confirms that COVID-19 patients with HM are at high risk of lethal complications. However, improved COVID-19 prevention has reduced mortality despite an increase in the number of reported cases.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Several molecular aberrations affect the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts (EB). This study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical impact of molecular genetic aberrations in Thai patients with AML and MDS-EB, detected by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. This prospective, observational study was conducted between 2018 and 2020 on newly diagnosed Thai AML or MDS-EB patients aged above 15 years. NGS was performed using a custom amplicon-based targeted enrichment assay for 42 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms. The molecular results were correlated with baseline patient and disease characteristics as well as outcomes. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44-64), with nearly equal proportions of males and females. The median number of mutations was 3 (IQR, 2-4). The most frequent alterations were FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) (28.6%), DNMT3A (24.5%), and WT1 (22.4%) mutations. FLT3-ITD was more frequent in the de novo AML group than in the MDS/secondary AML group, whereas in the MDS/secondary AML group, ASXL1, ETV6, and SRSF2 mutations were more frequent. Patients aged greater than 65 years and patients with mutated TP53 were more likely to have inferior overall survival from multivariate analysis. FLT3-ITD was the most common mutation among newly diagnosed Thai AML patients. TP53 mutation and advanced age were independent adverse factors for survival outcome. The genetic landscapes of AML patients vary between national populations. Thai Clinical Trials Registry identifier: TCTR20190227003.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is one of the most common somatic genomic alterations in hematopoietic cells in men. However, due to the high prevalence of LOY as the sole cytogenetic finding in the healthy older population, differentiating isolated LOY associated with clonal hematologic processes from aging-associated mosaicism can be difficult in the absence of definitive morphological features of disease. In the past, various investigators have proposed that a high percentage of metaphases with LOY is more likely to represent expansion of a clonal myeloid disease-associated population. It is unknown whether the proportion of metaphases with LOY is associated with the incidence of myeloid neoplasia-associated genomic alterations. To address this question, we identified bone marrow samples with LOY as an isolated cytogenetic finding and used targeted next generation sequencing-based molecular analysis to identify common myeloid neoplasia-associated somatic mutations. Among 73 patients with a median age of 75 years (range, 29-90), the percentage of metaphases with LOY was <25% in 23 patients, 25-49% in 10, 50-74% in 8 and >=75% in 32. A threshold of >=75% LOY was significantly associated with a morphological diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm (P=0.004). Furthermore, >=75% LOY was associated with a higher lifetime incidence of a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (P<0.0001), and in multivariate analysis >=75% LOY was a statistically significant independent predictor of myeloid neoplasia (odds ratio 6.17; 95% confidence interval: 2.15-17.68; P=0.0007]. Higher LOY percentage (>=75%) was associated with greater likelihood of having somatic mutations (P=0.0009) and a higher number of these mutations (P=0.0002). Our findings indicate that >=75% LOY in bone marrow cells is associated with an increased likelihood of molecular aberrations in genes commonly seen to be altered in myeloid neoplasia and with morphological features of MDS. These observations suggest that >=75% LOY in bone marrow should be considered an MDS-associated cytogenetic aberration.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with 7 + 3 induction, we evaluate the association between complete morphologic remission (CR) and long-term overall survival (OS) over four decades. We analyzed 1247 patients age (Formula presented.) 65 randomized to 7 + 3 arms from five SWOG studies. OS has improved over the four decades. Hazards for death in the two most recent studies fell after year 2. In multivariable models, decade of therapy was the most important variable with respect to long-term survival and CR by day 100 the second most important variable. Protocol/decade, which captures many factors not included in our multivariable model, was the most important predictor of being alive at year 2 or 3. The next most important factor was achievement of first CR by day 100.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The in vivo depletion of recipient and donor T lymphocytes using antithymocyte globulin (ATG; Thymoglobulin) is widely adopted in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) to reduce the incidence of both graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, excess toxicity to donor lymphocytes may hamper immune reconstitution, compromising antitumor effects and increasing infection. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administered early after HCT may increase ATG-mediated lymphotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an interaction between ATG and post-transplantation granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on allogeneic HCT outcomes, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry. We studied patients age >=18 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received Thymoglobulin-containing preparative regimens for HLA-matched sibling/unrelated or mismatched unrelated donor HCT between 2010 and 2018. The effect of planned G-CSF that was started between pretransplantation day 3 and post-transplantation day 12 was studied in comparison with transplantations that did not include G-CSF. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with outcomes at 1 year after transplantation. A total of 874 patients met the study eligibility criteria, of whom 459 (53%) received planned G-CSF. HCT with planned G-CSF was associated with a significantly increased risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; P <.0001; 21% versus 12%) compared to HCT without G-CSF. The 6-month incidence of viral infection was higher with G-CSF (56% versus 47%; P = .007), with a particular increase in Epstein-Barr virus infections (19% versus 11%; P = .002). The observed higher NRM with planned G-CSF led to lower overall survival (HR, 1.52; P = .0005; 61% versus 72%). There was no difference in GVHD risk between the treatment groups. We performed 2 subgroup analyses showing that our findings held true in patients age >=50 years and in centers where G-CSF was used in some, but not all, patients. In allogeneic peripheral blood HCT performed with Thymoglobulin for AML and MDS, G-CSF administered early post-transplantation resulted in a 2-fold increase in NRM and a 10% absolute decrement in survival. The use of planned G-CSF in the early post-transplantation period should be carefully considered on an individual patient basis, weighing any perceived benefits against these risks.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is the most effective tool to define a deep response in multiple myeloma (MM). We conducted an MRD correlative study of the EMN02/HO95 MM phase III trial in newly diagnosed MM patients achieving a suspected complete response before maintenance and every 6 months during maintenance. Patients received high-dose melphalan (HDM) versus bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) intensification, followed by bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRd) versus no consolidation, and lenalidomide maintenance. Bone marrow (BM) samples were processed in three European laboratories, applying EuroFlow-based MFC protocols (eight colors, two tubes) with 10-4-10-5 sensitivity. At enrollment in the MRD correlative study, 76% (244/321) of patients were MRD-negative. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after a median follow-up of 75 months, 5-year progression-free survival was 66% in MRD-negative versus 31% in MRD-positive patients (HR 0.39; p < 0.001), 5-year overall survival was 86% versus 69%, respectively (HR 0.41; p < 0.001). MRD negativity was associated with reduced risk of progression or death in all subgroups, including ISS-III (HR 0.37) and high-risk fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patients (HR 0.38;). In the 1-year maintenance MRD population, 42% of MRD-positive patients at pre-maintenance became MRD-negative after lenalidomide exposure. In conclusion, MRD by MFC is a strong prognostic factor. Lenalidomide maintenance further improved MRD-negativity rate.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - We analyzed variations in terms of chromosomal abnormalities (CA) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on purified bone marrow plasma cells throughout the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance/smoldering multiple myeloma (MGUS/SMM) to newly diagnosed MM/plasma cell leukemia (NDMM/PCL) at diagnosis and from diagnostic samples to progressive disease. High risk was defined by the presence of at least del(17p), t(4;14), and/or t(14;16). 1p/1q detection (in the standard FISH panel from 2012 onward) was not available for all patients. We analyzed 139 MM/PCL diagnostic samples from 144 patients, with a median follow-up of 71 months: high-risk CA at diagnosis (MGUS/SMM or NDMM) was present in 28% of samples, whereas 37-39% showed high-risk CA at relapse. In 115 patients with NDMM who evolved to relapsed/refractory MM, we identified 3 different populations: (1) 31/115 patients (27%) with gain of new CA (del13, del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16) or 1q CA when available); (2) 10/115 (9%) patients with loss of a previously identified CA; and (3) 74 patients with no changes. The CA gain group showed a median overall survival of 66 months vs. 84 months in the third group (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.92, p = 0.023). Clonal evolution occurs as disease progresses after different chemotherapy lines. Patients who acquired high-risk CA had the poorest prognosis. Our findings highlight the importance of performing FISH analysis both at diagnosis and at relapse.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Although measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been reported to be an important prognostic factor for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during first complete remission (CR1), the prognostic impact of MRD is unclear during second CR (CR2). To clarify the impact of MRD for both CR1 and CR2, we analyzed data from a registry database including 1625 adult patients with Ph1 ALL who underwent first allo-HCT during either CR1 or CR2 between 2002 and 2017. Adjusted overall and leukemia-free survival rates at 4 years were 71% and 64%, respectively, for patients undergoing allo-HCT during CR1 with MRD2, 55% and 43% during CR1 with MRD1, 51% and 49% during CR2 with MRD2, and 38% and 29% during CR2 with MRD1. Although survival rates were significantly better among patients with CR1 MRD2 than among patients with CR2 MRD2, no significant difference was observed in survival rate between patients with CR1 MRD1 and CR2 MRD2. Relapse rates after 4 years were 16% in patients with CR1 MRD2, 29% in CR1 MRD1, 21% in patients with CR2 MRD2, and 46% in patients with CR2 MRD1. No significant difference was identified in relapse rate between patients with CR1 MRD2 and CR2 MRD2. CR2 MRD2 was not a significant risk factor for relapse in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-2.29; P =.45 vs CR1 MRD2). MRD at time of allo-HCT was an important risk factor in patients with Ph1 ALL during both CR1 and CR2.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The financial burden of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is substantial. We retrospectively analyzed the hospital costs of the first induction therapy for 353 newly diagnosed AML patients who were admitted to our hospital from January 2013 to December 2018. We found the median hospital costs were estimated at 110,291.8 RMB. Multivariate analysis showed that length of hospital stay was the leading determinant affecting hospital costs (p < 0.0001), followed by length of agranulocytosis days (p < 0.01), but for the patients who failed to achieve complete remission (CR), length of hospital stay was the independent factor contributing to hospital costs. Besides, patients achieving CR had similar hospital costs to the patients failing to achieve CR. The hospital costs of low-intensity chemotherapy might not be lower than that of intensive chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Although the risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) associated with early cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (CMVR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well established, debate is ongoing on whether CMVR may reduce the risk of primary disease relapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate relapse protection following early CMV reactivation after HSCT in the context of the recipient HLA-C killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands (KIRLs). In this retrospective bicentric study, 406 matched related or unrelated donor transplantations for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were stratified by HLA-C KIRL group (homozygous versus heterozygous) and analyzed separately for the impact of early CMVR on the cumulative incidences of relapse, NRM, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) using landmark and multistate analyses. By landmark analysis of patients alive and relapse-free at 45 days post-HSCT, HLA-C KIRL homozygous recipients (C1/1 or C2/2) had a lower risk of subsequent relapse if CMVR occurred before this landmark (subhazard ratio [sHR], 0.36; P = .002). In contrast, in HLA-C KIRL heterozygous (C1/2) recipients, early CMVR had no impact on subsequent relapse (sHR, 0.88; P = .63). NRM (sHR, 3.31; P < .001) and grade III-IV acute GVHD (sHR, 2.60; P = .04) were significantly increased after early CMVR in the homozygous cohort, but not in the heterozygous cohort (NRM: sHR, 1.23; P = .53; grade III-IV acute GVHD: sHR, 1.40; P = .50). Multivariable landmark analyses and a multistate model confirmed the limitation of the relapse-protective effect of early CMVR to the homozygous cohort. Chronic GVHD and overall survival were not influenced in neither cohort. An antileukemic effect of early CMVR after HSCT for AML/MDS was significant but strictly limited to recipients homozygous for HLA-C KIRL. However, particularly in this cohort, CMVR had an adverse impact on aGVHD and NRM.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) report high symptom burden and functional disabilities resulting in impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Effective evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines are needed for patients with MM to improve HRQoL. The primary aim of this study was to investigate HRQoL in patients with rehabilitation needs living their everyday life. Patients with MM in remission attended a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation program including a 5-day residential course, home-based exercise and a 2-day follow-up course. The patients were referred by the treating haematologist and completed a booklet of validated HRQoL questionnaires at baseline and before arriving for the 2-day follow-up course. The proportion of participants with moderate to severe symptoms and functional problems were assessed at the two time points and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate explaining factors of impaired HRQoL at baseline. Ninety-two patients participated with a follow-up compliance rate of 90%. Median age was 67 years and median time since diagnosis was 26 months (ranged 5 months to 15.6 years). The most frequently reported symptoms were global quality of life, role functioning, fatigue, pain, peripheral neuropathy and physical functioning. Pain and fatigue were both highly coherent with impairment in physical functioning and those two symptoms explained most HRQoL impairments. Overall, the participants reported no change in HRQoL after the 12-week rehabilitation program. The study supports the need for an evidence-based guideline for rehabilitation and palliative care to patients with MM in remission living their everyday life.Copyright © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Imatinib is the mainstay of treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in Tanzania. Monitoring molecular response to therapy by real-time polymerase chain reaction at defined milestones is necessary for early detection of treatment failure. However, this assay is not routinely performed in Tanzania; therefore, the depth of molecular response among patients with CML is not known. A total of 158 patients with previously diagnosed CML who received imatinib treatment were recruited from January 2019 and followed up through October 2020 at Ocean Road Cancer Institute. Information was obtained at the time of diagnosis and follow-up. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes to measure the BCR/ABL ratio on the Gene Xpert system for molecular response determination. The median age of the 158 adult patients was 45 years (range, 18-86). By reference to established treatment milestones, only 37 (23.4%) achieved optimal molecular response. Signs of advanced-stage disease, in particular the need for red cell transfusions before diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.4; 95% CI, 1.32-9.17) and cytopenias (AOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.03-4.96) necessitating drug interruptions were statistically validated predictors of treatment failure on multivariate, multinomial logistic regression. Patient survival at the 22-month follow-up was lowest, with 78.6% (95% CI, 69.4-85.4) in the failure-to-respond category and highest in patients achieving optimal response 97.0% (95% CI, 80.9-99.6). In summary, the majority of patients with CML treated with imatinib in Tanzania do not obtain deep molecular response. This outcome can be attributed to late diagnosis, the development of cytopenias requiring multiple drug interruptions, and poor adherence to treatment.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The clinicopathologic features of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A)-mutated de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the significance of variant type, variant allele frequency (VAF), and multiple concomitant DNMT3A mutations, remain poorly defined. We examined 104 DNMT3A-mutated de novo AML patients from 2 major centers. Most (82%) had normal karyotype (NK); R882H variants were frequent(38%). The most commonly comutated genes included nucleophosmin (NPM1; 53%), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (25%), IDH1 (23%), IDH2 (23%), and TET2 (21%). Patients with high DNMT3A VAF at diagnosis (>=44%; DNMT3AHIGH) had more significant leukocytosis and higher blast counts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. DNMT3AHIGH cases were associated with much shorter event-free survival (EFS; 14.1 vs 56.8 months) and overall survival (OS; 18.3 months vs not reached) compared with cases of patients with low DNMT3A (DNMT3ALOW). Thirteen patients had 2 DNMT3A variants and similar VAFs at diagnosis that tracked together at multiple time points after chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation (SCT). In multivariable analyses performed in NK patients who received standard induction chemotherapy, presence of 2 DNMT3A mutations (hazard ratio [HR] 5 3.192; P = .038) and SCT in first complete remission (HR = 0.295; P = .001) independently affected EFS; increasing marrow blast percentage (HR = 1.026; P = .025), high DNMT3A VAF (HR = 3.003; P = .010), and 2 DNMT3A mutations (HR 5 4.816; P = .020) had independent effects on OS. These data support the adverse prognostic significance of DNMT3AHIGH reveal a novel association between 2 concomitant DNMT3A mutations and inferior outcome in DNMT3A-mutated de novo AML with a NK.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - For patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemia, there is no consensus regarding how long tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) should be given or whether TKI could be stopped if TKI is administrated after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We analyzed relapse-free survival (RFS) in 92 allo-HCT patients who received TKI for >3 months after allo-HCT, and aimed to develop a novel indicator, called as current TKI- & relapse-free (cTRFree) achievement. TKI after allo-HCT was started as planned in 39 patients, based on measurable residual disease (MRD) in 53 at a median of 152 days after allo-HCT. There was no difference in post-TKI RFS between the planned and MRD-based starting groups (P = 0.69). Second-generation TKIs were associated with superior RFS in Ph-positive acute leukemia (HR 2.71, P = 0.031). TKI was stopped before relapse in 48 patients. Stopping TKI as a time-dependent covariate was not associated with subsequent hematological relapse (HR 1.18, P = 0.72). In the TKI-stop group, TKI administration for >6 months tended to be associated with superior RFS (HR = 0.30, P = 0.08). As an indicator of transplant success, cTRFree was 35% 5 years after starting TKI. TKI could be stopped for recipients with sustained undetectable MRD. However, further prospective studies will be required to establish clinical recommendations.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities, including numerical aberrations and structural defects. However, no studies have examined the correlation between these abnormalities and survival in patients with ATL after allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). In this study, 300 patients with ATL (median age, 55 years; range, 24-74) who were registered in a Japanese nationwide registry database were analyzed. The majority (n =183) had acute ATL. Specimens for chromosomal analysis were collected from bone marrow (n = 166), lymph nodes (n = 86), peripheral blood (n = 41), and other locations (n = 7). In survival analyses, breakpoints at 2q (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.38; P =.012) and 5q (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.25-3.80; P =.006) were significantly poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). In terms of ATL-related death, loss of chromosome 14 and breakpoints at 3p, 1q, 5q, and 6q were extracted as significantly poor prognostic factors. Moreover, complex karyotypes were associated with ATL-related death. This study of the survival impact of chromosomal abnormalities in patients with ATL after allo-HSCT demonstrated that several structural breakpoints were independent risk factors for OS and ATL-related death.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one of the curative treatment options for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, the outcomes in patients transplanted without complete remission (non-CR) have not yet been fully reported, and detailed analyses are required to identify subgroups in which optimal prognosis is expected and to optimize pre-transplant therapeutic strategies. Hence, we performed a multicentred retrospective cohort study including a total of 663 adult ALL patients transplanted at non-CR status; the median bone marrow (BM) blast counts at HSCT was 13.2%, and 203 patients (30.6%) were treated at primary induction failure status. The overall survival (OS) was 31.1% at two years, and the multivariate analyses identified five prognostic risk factors, including older age (>=50 years), increased BM blasts (>=10%), poor performance status, high haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)-comorbidity index, and relapsed disease status, among which BM blast was the most significantly related. A predictive scoring system composed of these risk factors clearly stratified OS (15.6-59.5% at two years). In conclusion, this is the first large-scale study to analyze the correlation of patient characteristics with post-transplant prognosis in ALL transplanted at non-CR status. The importance of blast control before HSCT should be focused on for better patient prognosis.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Adult T-cell leukemia/leukemia (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T-cell malignancy, caused by infection with the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). We recently showed that the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is specifically and consistently overexpressed in ATLL cells, and functions as a novel cell surface marker. In this study, we first show that a soluble form of CADM1 (sCADM1) is secreted from ATLL cells by mainly alternative splicing. After developing the Alpha linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) for sCADM1, we show that plasma sCADM1 concentrations gradually increased during disease progression from indolent to aggressive ATLL. Although other known biomarkers of tumor burden such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2Ralpha) also increased with sCADM1 during ATLL progression, multivariate statistical analysis of biomarkers revealed that only plasma sCADM1 was selected as a specific biomarker for aggressive ATLL, suggesting that plasma sCADM1 may be a potential risk factor for aggressive ATLL. In addition, plasma sCADM1 is a useful marker for monitoring response to chemotherapy as well as for predicting relapse of ATLL. Furthermore, the change in sCADM1 concentration between indolent and aggressive type ATLL was more prominent than the change in the percentage of CD4+CADM1+ ATLL cells. As plasma sCADM1 values fell within normal ranges in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients with higher levels of serum sIL-2Ralpha, the measurement of sCADM1 may become a useful tool to discriminate between ATLL and other inflammatory diseases, including HAM/TSP.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in nonremission acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are dismal [2-year overall survival (OS): 20-30%]. Though several risk classifications have been used, some factors are unavailable until the start of conditioning or transplantation. We analyzed prognostic gene mutations by targeted next-generation sequencing to identify predisposing factors for predicting OS at 1 month before transplantation. We enrolled 120 patients with nonremission AML who underwent first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2018. Mutations were found in 98 patients; frequently mutated genes were FLT3-ITD, TP53, RUNX1, and WT1. TP53 mutation was detected in 21 patients and was the only predictor of poor OS. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression hazard model revealed primary AML, monosomal karyotype (MK), and TP53 mutation as independent factors for predicting poor OS. Based on these, patients were stratified into three groups. The low-risk group included patients with prior myeloid disorder without MK (n = 26). Among the rest, patients with TP53 mutation were assigned to the high-risk group (n = 19) and the rest into the intermediate-risk group (n = 75). Two-year OS in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups differed significantly (50.0%, 24.9%, and 0%, respectively). This suggests that the indication of allo-HSCT should be carefully judged for high-risk patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis for unmanipulated haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation includes post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Utilizing data in the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, we compared ATG-versus PTCy-based GvHD prophylaxis in 434 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation. Of the 434 patients included in this study, ATG was used in 98 and PTCy in 336.. The median follow-up was approximately 2 years. The baseline characteristics of the patients were similar between the groups except that the ATG group was more likely to have had relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.008), had conditioning not including total body irradiation (P<0.001), have had peripheral blood as the source of their grafts (P<=0.001) and to have been transplanted in an earlier time-period (median year of transplantation: 2011 vs. 2015). The 100-day rates of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD were similar in the ATG and PTCy groups, as were 2-year chronic GvHD rates. On multivariate analysis, leukemia-free survival and overall survival were better with PTCy than with ATG prophylaxis. Relapse incidence was lower in the PTCy group (P=0.03), while non-relapse mortality was not different. Advanced disease and lower performance score were associated with poorer leukemia-free survival and overall survival and advanced disease was associated with inferior GvHD-free/relapse-free survival. Compared to bone marrow grafts, peripheral grafts were associated with higher rates of GvHD. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing unmanipulated haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation, PTCy for GvHD prevention resulted in a lower incidence of relapse and improved leukemia-free survival and overall survival, compared to ATG.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

N2  - Background: Non-T-cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HaploSCT) is being increasingly used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with improving patient outcomes. We have recently reported that outcomes of adult patients (pts) with ALL in complete remission (CR) receiving HaploSCT are comparable to unrelated donor transplants. We now compared HaploSCT and matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants in pts with ALL. Aim(s): To assess transplantation outcomes of HaploSCT and MSD transplants in pts with ALL in CR. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed adult patients (>= 18 years) with ALL who underwent their first allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in first or second CR between 2012 and 2018, either from a T cell replete Haplo or MSD donor, and whose data were reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Multivariate analysis (MVA) adjusting for differences between the groups was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Propensity score matching was also performed to reduce confounding effects. Result(s): The analysis comprised 2304 patients: HaploSCT-413; MSD-1891. Median follow-up was 25 months. Median age was 37 (range 18-75) and 38 (18-76) years in HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. HaploSCT patients were transplanted more recently than those transplanted from MSD (2016 vs 2015, p < 0.0001). A higher rate of HaploSCT was in CR2 (33.4% vs 16.7%, p < 0.0001), respectively, and fewer received myeloablative conditioning (68% vs 83.2%, p < 0.0001). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity was lower in HaploSCT patients (22% vs 28%, p = 0.01) and donors (27.1% vs 33%, p < 0.02), and a higher proportion of the HaploSCTs were performed using a bone marrow (BM) graft (46.2% vs 18.6%, p < 0.0001). The 2 groups did not differ with regard to gender, Karnofsky performance status score, ALL phenotype, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positivity and pre-alloSCT measurable residual disease (MRD). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was mainly post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) based (92.7%) in the HaploSCT setting, while it was mostly pharmacologic in the setting of MSD (18.7% received ATG). Cumulative incidence of engraftment at day 60 was higher in MSD transplants compared to HaploSCT (98.7% vs 96.3%, p = 0.001), respectively. Day 180 incidence of acute (a) GVHD II-IV and III-IV was higher in HaploSCT vs. MSD: 36.3% vs 28.9% (p = 0.002 and 15.2% vs 10.5% (p = 0.005), respectively. Conversely, the 2-year chronic (c) GVHD and extensive cGVHD were 32% vs 38.8% (p = 0.009) and 11.9% vs 19.5% (p = 0.001) in HaploSCT vs MSD, respectively. Main causes of death were leukemia (31.8% vs 45%), infection (33.1% vs 19.7%) and GVHD (16.6% vs 19.7%) for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. Two-year relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 26% vs 31.6%, 22.9% vs 13%, 51% vs 55.4%, 58.8% vs 67.4% and 40.6% vs 39% for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. In the MVA, RI was significantly lower in HaploSCT in comparison with MSD, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66 (95% CI 0.52-0.83, p = 0.004), while NRM was significantly higher, HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.43-2.53, p < 0.0001). aGVHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV were higher in HaploSCT than in MSD HR = 1.53 (95% CI 1.23-1.9, p = 0.0002) and HR = 1.54 (95% CI 1.1-2.15, p = 0.011), respectively. Extensive cGVHD was lower in HaploSCT compared with MSD, HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.43-0.88, p = 0.007), while total cGVHD did not differ significantly, HR = 0.94 (95% CI 0.74-1.18, p = 0.58). LFS, OS and GRFS did not differ significantly between the 2 transplant groups, HR = 0.96 (95% CI 0.81-1.14, p = 0.66); HR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.96-1.43, p = 0.11) and HR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.79-1.09, p = 0.37), respectively. These results were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. Conclusion(s): Outcomes of adult patients with ALL in CR receiving alloSCT from haploidentical donors are not significantly different from those receiving transplants from MSD in terms of LFS, OS and GRFS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - A mismatched unrelated (MMUD) donor represents an alternative therapeutic option for patients who need allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) and do not have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor. We studied outcomes of patients with acute leukemia transplanted from >=2 HLA allele MMUD. The study population consisted of 465 patients. The median follow-up period was 63 and 75 months in the AML and ALL groups, respectively. The incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute (a) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) during the first 100 days was 37% and 16%, respectively. Total and extensive chronic (c) GVHD rates at 2 years were 38% and 17%, respectively. In the entire population, the 5-year relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival and refined GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 33%, 31%, 37%, 41%, and 27%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, HLA-DR mismatch was a poor prognostic factor, giving a significantly higher NRM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.67, p = 0.02]; poorer LFS (HR, 1.42, p = 0.03); OS (HR, 1.46, p = 0.03) and higher aGVHD grade II-IV (HR, 1.46, p = 0.05). In this study, allo-HCT from <=6/8 HLA allele MMUD in acute leukemia patients resulted in acceptable LFS and refined GRFS. HLA-DR mismatch was a poor prognostic factor.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - We compared the outcomes of salvage chemotherapy in 146 patients with relapsed (57.5%) or refractory (42.5%) AML who received CLAG-M (51%), MEC (39%) or CLAG (10%). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by flow cytometry. Bivariate, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses were conducted. Complete remission (CR) rate of 46% (CLAG-M 54% versus MEC/CLAG 40%, p =.045) was observed with MRD-negative CR of 33% (CLAG-M 39% versus MEC/CLAG 22%, p =.042). Median overall survival (OS) was 9.7 months; the longest OS occurred with CLAG-M (13.3, 95%CI 2.4-24.3) versus MEC (6.9, 95%CI 2.9-10.9) or CLAG (6.2, 95%CI 2.4-12.6) (p =.025). When adjusted for age, gender, relapsed/refractory AML, poor risk AML, MRD, chemotherapy and transplant, CLAG-M (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.98, p =.042), MRD-negativity (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.30, p <.001) and transplant (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13-0.39, p <.001) were associated with higher OS. Our findings confirm that CLAG-M is a reasonable salvage regimen for RR-AML followed by transplant.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Patients with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) who develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) are perceived to have worse outcomes than autologous HCT recipients and non-transplant patients with hematologic malignancy (HM). Within a large international prospective cohort, we evaluated clinical outcomes in these 3 populations. We conducted a secondary analysis of the EFRAIM study, a multicenter observational study of immunocompromised adults with ARF admitted to 62 intensive care units (ICUs) in 16 countries. We described characteristics and compared outcomes of patients with HM who did not undergo transplantation and patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HCT using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score-matched analyses. A total of 801 patients were included: 570 who did not undergo transplantation, 86 autologous HCT recipients and 145 allogeneic HCT recipients. Acute myelogenous leukemia (171 of 570; 30%) was the most common HM and most common indication for allogeneic HCT (76 of 145; 52%). Compared with the patients who did not undergo HCT and autologous HCT recipients, allogeneic HCT recipients were younger, had fewer comorbid conditions, and were more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy in the ICU. Unadjusted ICU and hospital mortality were 35% and 45%, respectively, across the entire cohort. In multivariable regression analysis, autologous HCT (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], .57 to 2.03; P = .82) and allogeneic HCT (OR, .99; 95% CI, .60 to 1.66; P = .98) were not associated with higher hospital mortality compared with the no-HCT cohort, adjusting for demographic, functional, clinical, malignancy, and ARF characteristics. The results were similar when analyzed using propensity score-matching techniques. Our findings indicate that autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients who develop ARF and require ICU admission have similar hospital mortality as patients with HM not treated with HCT.

N2  - Community respiratory viral infections (CRVIs) are associated with pulmonary function impairment, alloimmune lung syndromes and inferior survival in human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Although the incidence of viral infections in HLA-haploidentical HCT recipients who receive post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is reportedly increased, there are insufficient data describing the incidence of CRVIs and the impact of donor source and PTCy on transplant outcomes. Analysing patients receiving their first HCT between 2012 and 2017 for acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, we describe comparative outcomes between matched sibling transplants receiving either calcineurin-based GVHD prophylaxis (SibCNI, N = 1605) or PTCy (SibCy, N = 403), and related haploidentical transplants receiving PTCy (HaploCy, N = 757). The incidence of CRVIs was higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor type. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRVI by day +180 had both a higher risk of treatment-related mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 214, 99% confidence interval (CI) 113-407; P = 0002] and inferior 2-year overall survival (HR 165, 99% CI 111-243; P = 0001) compared to SibCNI with no CRVI. This finding justifies further research into long-term antiviral immune recovery, as well as development of preventive and treatment strategies to improve long-term outcomes in such patients.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Second malignant neoplasms (SMN) pose a concern for survivors of childhood cancer. We evaluated incidence, type and risk factors for SMN in patients included in Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocols for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.3,590 patients <15 years of age at diagnosis, registered between 01/1981 and 06/2010, were analyzed. SMN were reported by the treating institutions and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. After a median follow-up of 9.4 years (quartile [Q] range, Q1 6.7 and Q3 12.1) 95 SMN were registered (26 carcinomas including nine basal cell carcinomas, 21 acute myeloid leukemias/myelodysplastic syndromes, 20 lymphoid malignancies, 12 central nervous system [CNS]-tumors, and 16 others). Cumulative incidence at 20 years was 5.7+/-0.7%, standard incidence ratio, excluding basal cell carcinomas, was 19.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 14.5-26.5). Median time from initial diagnosis to second malignancy was 8.7 years (range, 0.2-30.3 years). Acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-type therapy, cumulative anthracycline dose, and cranial radiotherapy for brain tumor-development were significant risk factors in univariate analysis only. In multivariate analysis including risk factors significant in univariate analysis, female sex (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI: 1.23-2.86, P=0.004), CNS-involvement (HR 2.24, 95% CI: 1.03-4.88, P=0.042), lymphoblastic lymphoma (HR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.69-3.97, P<0.001), and cancer-predisposing condition (HR 11.2, 95% CI: 5.52-22.75, P<0.001) retained an independent risk. Carcinomas were the most frequent SMN after non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood followed by acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoid malignancies. Female sex, lymphoblastic lymphoma, CNS-involvement, or/and known cancer-predisposing condition were risk factors for SMN-development. Our findings set the basis for individualized long-term follow-up and risk assessment of new therapies.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Prediction of resistant disease at initial diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be achieved with high accuracy using cytogenetic data and 29 gene expression markers (Predictive Score 29 Medical Research Council; PS29MRC). Our aim was to establish PS29MRC as a clinically usable assay by using the widely implemented NanoString platform and further validate the classifier in a more recently treated patient cohort. Analyses were performed on 351 patients with newly diagnosed AML intensively treated within the German AML Cooperative Group registry. As a continuous variable, PS29MRC performed best in predicting induction failure in comparison with previously published risk models. The classifier was strongly associated with overall survival. We were able to establish a previously defined cutoff that allows classifier dichotomization (PS29MRCdic). PS29MRCdic significantly identified induction failure with 59% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and 72% overall accuracy (odds ratio, 4.81; P 5 4.15 3 10210). PS29MRCdic was able to improve the European Leukemia Network 2017 (ELN-2017) risk classification within every category. The median overall survival with high PS29MRCdic was 1.8 years compared with 4.3 years for low-risk patients. In multivariate analysis including ELN-2017 and clinical and genetic markers, only age and PS29MRCdic were independent predictors of refractory disease. In patients aged $60 years, only PS29MRCdic remained as a significant variable. In summary, we confirmed PS29MRC as a valuable classifier to identify high-risk patients with AML. Risk classification can still be refined beyond ELN-2017, and predictive classifiers might facilitate clinical trials focusing on these high-risk patients with AML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ETP-ALL/LBL) is characterized by a distinct immunophenotype (CD1a-negative, CD8-negative, CD5-negative or weak-positive <75%, myeloid/stem-cell markers positive) and poor clinical outcomes. Near-ETP ALL is transcriptionally similar to ETP-ALL but CD5 expression level is not low enough to meet the criteria of ETP immunophenotype. Outcomes of near-ETP ALL are not well characterized. We reviewed 171 patients with newly-diagnosed T-ALL/LBL. Patients were categorized into three groups; ETP (N = 27), near-ETP (N = 24), and non-ETP ALL/LBL (N = 120). ETP-ALL/LBL was associated with a significantly worse survival compared with non-ETP ALL/LBL: 5-year overall survival (OS) rates 32% versus 63% (p <.001). Outcome was similar between near-ETP and non-ETP ALL/LBL: 5-year OS rates 56% versus 63% (p =.543). Landmark analysis showed that allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in first remission was beneficial in ETP-ALL/LBL (5-year event-free survival rates 36% versus 18%, p =.030) but not in near-ETP or non-ETP ALL/LBL. Multivariate analysis selected the following as significant independent prognostic factors for OS: age >= 60 years (HR 3.11; p =.003); elevated WBC >=100 x 109/L (HR 2.60; p =.005); and ETP immunophenotype (HR 2.29; p =.010). A survival advantage with adding nelarabine to hyper-CVAD was observed in non-ETP ALL (5-year OS rates 83% versus 38% with hyper-CVAD plus neralabine versus hyper-CVAD, p =.003). In conclusion, outcome of ETP-ALL/LBL was poor and improved with allo-SCT; outcome of near-ETP ALL/LBL was similar to non-ETP ALL/LBL; the addition of nelarabine to hyper-CVAD improved the survival in non-ETP ALL only.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the effects of patient and donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching status on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been extensively elucidated, but the effects of specific HLAs on acute GVHD remain unclear. Using data from a Japanese registry, we retrospectively analyzed 4392 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who received transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors to investigate the effects of HLAs on acute GVHD. From unbiased searches of HLA-A, -B, and -DR, HLA-B60 was significantly associated with an increased risk of grades II-IV acute GVHD (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.59; P = 0.001). In contrast, HLA-B62 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of grades II-IV (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.87; P < 0.001) and III-IV acute GVHD (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87; P = 0.005). The risk of leukemia relapse was significantly higher in HLA-B62-positive patients than in HLA-B62-negative patients (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43; P = 0.01). Both HLA-B60 and -B62 did not affect overall survival. The findings of this study may by implication suggest the possibility that the effects of specific HLAs on transplant outcomes may reflect inherent biological features, and thus consideration of specific HLAs may be helpful to predict transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Outcomes in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) are highly variable and may be affected by comorbidity. Therefore, prognostic models and comorbidity indices are important tools to estimate survival and to guide clinicians in individualising treatment. In this nationwide population-based study, we assess comorbidities and for the first time validate comorbidity indices in CMML. We also compare the prognostic power of: the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS), MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System (MDAPS) and Mayo score. In this cohort of 337 patients with CMML, diagnosed between 2009 and 2015, the median overall survival was 21.3 months. Autoimmune conditions were present in 25% of the patients, with polymyalgia rheumatica and Hashimoto's thyroiditis being most common. Of the tested comorbidity indices: the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Specific Comorbidity Index (MDS-CI), CCI had the highest C-index (0.62) and was the only comorbidity index independently associated with survival in multivariable analyses. When comparing the prognostic power of the scoring systems, the CPSS had the highest C-index (0.69). In conclusion, using 'real-world' data we found that the CCI and CPSS have the best prognostic power and that autoimmune conditions are overrepresented in CMML.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Talacotuzumab, a humanized anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in combination with decitabine in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. A multicenter, phase 2/3 study was initiated to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of talacotuzumab (Part A) followed by an open-label, randomized comparison of talacotuzumab in combination with decitabine versus decitabine alone to assess achievement of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS) in Part B. Ten patients were enrolled in Part A and 316 in Part B; the results presented here are based on a database lock on January 25, 2018. Part A confirmed the RP2D of talacotuzumab to be 9 mg/kg. In Part B, CR was achieved in 12/80 (15%) patients receiving combination therapy and in 9/82 (11%) patients receiving decitabine alone (odds ratio: 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6-3.6; p = 0.44). Median (95% CI) OS was 5.36 (4.27-7.95) months for combination therapy versus 7.26 (6.47-8.64) months for decitabine alone (hazard ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.79-1.37; p = 0.78). Combination therapy showed no improvement in efficacy versus decitabine alone, resulting in the Independent Data Monitoring Committee's recommendation of early termination of enrollment and discontinuation of talacotuzumab treatment.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - PCR of TCR/Ig gene rearrangements is considered the method of choice for minimal residual disease (MRD) quantification in BCP-ALL, but flow cytometry analysis of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (FCM-MRD) is faster and biologically more informative. FCM-MRD performed in 18 laboratories across seven countries was used for risk stratification of 1487 patients with BCP-ALL enrolled in the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. When no informative FCM-marker was available, risk stratification was based on real-time quantitative PCR. An informative FCM-marker was found in 96.2% and only two patients (0.14%) had non-informative FCM and non-informative PCR-markers. The overall 5-year event-free survival was 86.1% with a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR5y) of 9.5%. FCM-MRD levels on days 15 (HzR 4.0, p < 0.0001), 29 (HzR 2.7, p < 0.0001), and 79 (HzR 3.5, p < 0.0001) associated with hazard of relapse adjusted for age, cytogenetics, and WBC. The early (day 15) response associated with CIR5y adjusted for day 29 FCM-MRD, with higher levels in adults (median 2.4 x 10-2 versus 5.2 x 10-3, p < 0.0001). Undetectable FCM- and/or PCR-MRD on day 29 identified patients with a very good outcome (CIR5y = 3.2%). For patients who did not undergo transplantation, day 79 FCM-MRD > 10-4 associated with a CIR5y = 22.1%. In conclusion, FCM-MRD performed in a multicenter setting is a clinically useful method for MRD-based treatment stratification in BCP-ALL.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Limited information is available on the efficacy of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTcy) or thymoglobulin for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) transplants. We retrospectively compared outcomes of 76 adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent 7/8 HLA-MMUD transplantation and received either PTcy (50 mg/kg on day 3 and 4) or thymoglobulin (total dose 4.5 mg/kg) for GVHD prophylaxis. In addition, tacrolimus and mycophenolate were used in both groups. Propensity score-based multivariable analyses (PSCA) were performed to adjust confounding effects of patient characteristics between both groups. Between January 2006 and June 2019, 25 patients received PTcy, and 51 received thymoglobulin. Median age of the population was 57 years, 78% of patients had AML, most common graft source was peripheral blood (96%), and 46% received myeloablative conditioning regimens. Median time to neutrophil (15 versus 11 days, P <.001) and platelet engraftment (21 versus 15 days, P =.002) was prolonged in the PTcy group. The cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD at day 100 was similar (12% versus 19.6%, P =.38), whereas chronic GVHD at 1 year was lower with PTcy compared to thymoglobulin (16% versus 49%, P =.006). Using PSCA, no difference in survival, relapse, relapse-free survival, and GVHD-free relapse-free survival was seen between groups. However, thymoglobulin was associated with higher incidence of acute (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.63, P =.01) and chronic GVHD (HR = 4.43, P =.03), and non-relapse mortality (HR 3.38, P =.04) compared to PTcy. Our study demonstrated that PTcy resulted in significantly lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD and non-relapse mortality compared to thymoglobulin in 7/8 HLA-MMUD transplants for AML and MDS.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d x 5 and melphalan 140 mg/m2 x 1 (Flu-Mel140) is a commonly used reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. We hypothesized that addition of 200cGy total body irradiation (TBI) to Flu-Mel140 may improve antitumor activity and transplant outcomes. Primary objectives was overall survival (OS) at 3 years. Secondary objectives were to assess the cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GVHD, relapse-free survival (RFS), relapse rate, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of patients receiving Flu-Mel140-TBI followed by HLA-matched donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) using peripheral blood stem cells. Eighty-one patients (median age, 58 years) underwent alloSCT between January 2008 and December 2018. Thirty-one percent of patients had a prior transplant, 32% had high or very-high disease risk index, and the donor was unrelated in 70% of patients. Grade 3 to 4 regimen-related toxicities were mucositis (37%), cardiac toxicity (17%), and renal toxicity (10%). The cumulative incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD at day +100 was 24.7% and chronic GVHD at 1 year was 51.3%. Median follow-up for survival was 6.1 years. At 3 years, OS was 39.81%, RFS was 31.47%, and relapse rate was 30.5%. One-year NRM was 29.9%. Patients undergoing first transplantation experienced improved OS compared with second or beyond (63.08% versus 42.31%, P = .02). After adjusting for disease subtypes, age (<=55 versus 55), comorbidity index (CI), number of transplant and GVHD prophylaxis, multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any survival difference among disease subtypes. High CI (>=3) was predictive of adverse OS and NRM, whereas older age (>55 years) was associated with high NRM. Our study shows that Flu-Mel140-TBI seems feasible and provides durable disease control. Addition of TBI did not appear to improve outcomes compared to previously published reports of Flu-Mel140. Considerable NRM could result from the inclusion of patients with older age and prior transplants.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - A head-to-head comparison of outcomes of unrelated donor allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for AML between reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens using thymoglobulin for GVHD prophylaxis is limited. We evaluated outcomes of 122 AML patients who received either busulfan (Bu)/fludarabine (Flu)/low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) as RIC (n = 64, 52%) or Bu/Flu as MAC (n = 58, 48%), and thymoglobulin 4.5 mg/kg total dose between day - 3 to - 1 for GVHD prophylaxis. Grades III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) was lower with Bu/Flu/TBI compared with Bu/Flu (6.2% vs 26.1%, p = 0.009). At 1 year, Bu/Flu/TBI was associated with similar chronic GVHD (41.2% vs 44.8%, p = 0.75), OS (61.9% vs 56.9%, p = 0.69), relapse rate (29.9% vs 20.7%, p = 0.24), relapse-free survival (52.8% vs 50%, p = 0.80), non-relapse mortality (17.4% vs 29.3%, p = 0.41), and GVHD-free relapse-free survival (24.2% vs 27.5%, p = 0.80) compared with Bu/Flu. Multivariable analysis did not reveal any difference in outcomes between both regimens. In summary, thymoglobulin at 4.5 mg/kg did not have any adverse impact on survival when used with RIC regimen. Both Bu/Flu/TBI and Bu/Flu conditioning regimens yielded similar survival.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a standard therapy for patients with intermediate to high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with improved long-term disease-free survival. Disparity exists in access to HCT among different patient populations and requires further study. In this study, we compared HCT rates for AML among different regions in the state of Virginia and identified geographic and socioeconomic factors associated with the likelihood of receiving HCT. We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of patients 18 to 74 years of age diagnosed with AML in Virginia from 2013 to 2017 as reported to the Virginia Cancer Registry (VCR); the VCR was further linked with the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database for identification of patients who had undergone HCT within 2 years of diagnosis. Socioeconomic data were generated from the VCR and the American Community Survey. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine selected socioeconomic factors of interest, including patient-level information such as sex, age, race, marital status, and primary insurance payer, as well as factors associated with geography, including the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and percentage of African Americans residing in the region. In Virginia, 818 patients were diagnosed with AML from 2013 to 2017, and, of these, 168 patients (21%) underwent HCT within 2 years of diagnosis. Median age was lower in the HCT cohort (55 years) versus the non-HCT cohort (64 years) (P <.001). There was a higher proportion of married patients in the HCT cohort (67%) versus the non-HCT cohort (53%) (P =.005). The rate of HCT varied by geographic region (P =.004). The multivariable analyses (without including SVI) showed decreased likelihood of HCT with increasing age (odds ratio [OR],.96; 95% confidence interval [CI],.95 to.98). Patients from regions that had a greater than 25% African American population were less likely to undergo HCT (OR,.58; 95% CI,.38 to.89). Patients who were not married were less likely to undergo HCT compared with married patients (OR,.56; 95% CI,.36 to.88). Patients with government-sponsored insurance as the primary payer were less likely to undergo HCT compared with patients with private insurance (OR,.49; 95% CI,.32 to.77). Patients living in Zip Code areas with a greater percentage of population with a bachelor's or graduate degree were more likely to undergo HCT (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03). In a separate multivariate model with SVI, patients residing in a Zip Code with higher SVI were less likely to undergo HCT (OR,.37; 95% CI,.16 to.82). From 2013 to 2017, we found that the likelihood of a patient undergoing HCT in Virginia for AML within 2 years of diagnosis was negatively associated with increasing age, percent of African Americans residing in the region, not-married relationship status, government-sponsored insurance as primary payer, higher SVI, and decreased percent of population with a bachelor's or graduate degree. Resources should be directed toward at-risk patient populations to remove barriers to improve access to HCT. The SVI can be used to identify communities at risk nationwide.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia (Ph+ AML) confers a dismal prognosis when treated with chemotherapy alone. Data on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) outcomes are limited. We retrospectively analyzed 4649 AML patients who received allo-HCT and were in complete remission. Outcomes of Ph+ AML (n = 30), intermediate-risk, and poor-risk AML patients were compared. The 3-year overall survival after allo-HCT was similar in intermediate-risk (62.7%; 95% CI: 61.0-64.3%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.42); however, it differed significantly between the poor-risk (49.7%; 95% CI: 45.9-53.4%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.049). Disease-free survival in Ph+ AML patients was comparable to that in intermediate-risk patients but better than that in poor-risk patients. Relapse rates were significantly lower in Ph+ AML patients than in other groups. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were similar among groups. Multivariate analysis showed that Ph+ AML was not a significant predictor of poor prognosis in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and NRM. Our data showed better post-transplant outcomes for Ph+ AML patients than for those with poor-risk AML. Hence, allo-HCT could be a feasible treatment option for Ph+ AML patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - IKZF1 deletions (DIKZF1) are commonly detected in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-ALL) and are widely assumed to have a significant impact on outcome. We compared the ability of multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect DIKZF1 and to determine the impact on event-free survival of patients with precursor B-ALL aged 23 to 65 years recruited to the completed trial UKALL14 (ISRCTN 66541317). From 655 recruits with BCR-ABL11 and BCRABL12 B-ALL, all available diagnostic DNA samples (76% of the recruited population) were screened by multiplex end point PCR covering 4 deletions: dominant-negative (DN) D4-7 or the loss of function D2-7, D4-8, and D2-8 (n 5 498), MLPA (n 5 436), or by both (n 5 420). Although patients with BCR-ABL12 DIKZF1 were more likely to have minimal residual disease at the end of induction, we did not find any impact of DIKZF1 (including subgroup analysis for DN or loss-of-function lesions) or the IKZF1plus genotype on event-free, overall survival, or relapse risk by univariable or multivariable analyses. Consistent with the technical approach, MLPA not only detected a wider range of deletions than PCR but also failed to detect some PCR-detected lesions. The main difference between our study and others reporting an association between DIKZF1 and outcome is the older age of participants in our population. The impact of DIKZF1 in ALL may be less marked in an older population of patients. Our study underscores the need for analyses in large, harmonized data sets. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01085617.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Limited data are available on legionellosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The aim of this study was to report the cases of legionellosis and to identify predictors of legionellosis, legionellosis-associated death, and non-relapse mortality (NRM). All cases of post-HSCT legionellosis from the EBMT registry were included and matched with controls in a 3:1 ratio for the analyses of risk factors. In the years 1995-2016, 80 cases from 52 centers in 14 countries were identified (mainly from France, Italy, and Spain). Median time from HSCT to legionellosis was 203 days (range, 0-4099); 19 (23.8%) patients developed early legionellosis (within-day +30 post-HSCT). Patients were mainly male (70%), after allogeneic HSCT (70%), with acute leukemia (27.5%), lymphoma (23.8%), or multiple myeloma (21.3%), and the median age of 46.6 (range, 7.2-68.2). Predictors of legionellosis were allogeneic HSCT (OR = 2.27, 95%CI:1.08-4.80, p = 0.03) and recent other infection (OR = 2.96, 95%CI:1.34-6.52, p = 0.007). Twenty-seven (33.8%) patients died due to legionellosis (44% after early legionellosis), NRM was 50%. Predictors of NRM were female sex (HR = 2.19, 95%CI:1.13-4.23, p = 0.02), early legionellosis (HR = 2.24, 95%CI:1.13-4.46, p = 0.02), and south-eastern geographical region (HR = 2.16, 95%CI:1.05-4.44, p = 0.036). In conclusion, legionellosis is a rare complication after HSCT, mainly allogeneic, occurring frequently within 30 days after HSCT and associated with high mortality.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Infections are a known complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy with data largely emerging from CD19 CAR T-cell targeting. As CAR T-cell therapy continues to evolve, infection risks and management thereof will become increasingly important to optimize outcomes across the spectrum of antigens and disease targeted. We retrospectively characterized infectious complications occurring in 162 children and adults treated among 5 phase 1 CAR T-cell clinical trials. Trials included targeting of CD19, CD22, disialoganglioside (GD2) or B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Fifty-three patients (32.7%) had 76 infections between lymphocyte depleting (LD) chemotherapy and day 30 (D30); with the majority of infections (61, 80.3%) occurring between day 0 (D0) and D30. By trial, the highest proportion of infections was seen with CD22 CAR T cells (n 5 23/53; 43.4%), followed by BCMA CAR T cells (n 5 9/24; 37.5%). By disease, patients with multiple myeloma had the highest proportion of infections (9/24; 37.5%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36/102; 35.3%). Grade 4 infections were rare (n 5 4; 2.5%). Between D0 and D30, bacteremia and bacterial site infections were the most common infection type. In univariate analysis, increasing prior lines of therapy, recent infection within 100 days of LD chemotherapy, corticosteroid or tocilizumab use, and fever and neutropenia were associated with a higher risk of infection. In a multivariable analysis, only prior lines of therapy and recent infection were associated with higher risk of infection. In conclusion, we provide a broad overview of infection risk within the first 30 days post infusion across a host of multiple targets and diseases, elucidating both unique characteristics and commonalities highlighting aspects important to improving patient outcomes.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Background: Patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia are at an increased risk of treatment-related mortality and relapse, which is influenced by unfavourable genetic aberrations (eg, IKZF1 deletion). We aimed to investigate the potential underlying effect of Down syndrome versus the effects of adverse cancer genetics on clinical outcome. Method(s): Patients (aged 1-23 years) with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls) from eight trials (DCOG ALL10 and ALL11, ANZCHOG ALL8, AIEOP-BFM ALL2009, UKALL2003, NOPHO ALL2008, CoALL 07-03, and CoALL 08-09) done between 2002 and 2018 across various countries (the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Germany) were included. Participants were matched (1:3) for clinical risk factors and genetics, including IKZF1 deletion. The primary endpoint was the comparison of MRD levels (absolute MRD levels were categorised into two groups, low [<0.0001] and high [>=0.0001]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls, and the secondary outcomes were comparison of long-term outcomes (event-free survival, overall survival, relapse, and treatment-related mortality [TRM]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls. Two matched cohorts were formed: for MRD analyses and for long-term outcome analyses. For both cohorts, matching was based on induction regimen; for the long-term outcome cohort, matching also included MRD-guided treatment group. We used mixed-effect models, Cox models, and competing risk for statistical analyses. Finding(s): Of 251 children and adolescents with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 136 were eligible for analyses and matched to 407 (of 8426) non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls). 113 patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia were excluded from matching in accordance with predefined rules, no match was available for two patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The proportion of patients with high MRD at the end of induction treatment was similar for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (52 [38%] of 136) and matched controls (157 [39%] of 403; OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.64-1.46]; p=0.88). Patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia had a higher relapse risk than did matched controls in the IKZF1 deleted group (relapse at 5 years 37.1% [17.1-57.2] vs 13.2% [6.1-23.1]; cause-specific hazard ratio [HRcs] 4.3 [1.6-11.0]; p=0.0028), but not in the IKZF1 wild-type group (relapse at 5 years 5.8% [2.1-12.2] vs 8.1% [5.1-12.0]; HRcs 1.0 [0.5-2.1]; p=0.99). In addition to increased induction deaths (15 [6%] of 251 vs 69 [0.8%] of 8426), Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia was associated with a higher risk of post-induction TRM compared with matched controls (TRM at 5 years 12.2% [7.0-18.9] vs 2.7% [1.3-4.9]; HRcs 5.0 [2.3-10.8]; p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Induction treatment is equivalently effective for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and for matched patients without Down syndrome. Down syndrome itself provides an additional risk in individuals with IKZF1 deletions, suggesting an interplay between the germline environment and this poor risk somatic aberration. Different treatment strategies are warranted considering both inherent risk of relapse and high risk of TRM.

N2  - Carfilzomib, a next-generation proteasome inhibitor, improves outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma (MM); however, a proportion of those treated develop renal failure due to adverse event, comorbidity, or myeloma progression. The rate of renal failure and associated risk factors remains unknown in real-world populations. Adults with relapsed/refractory MM who received carfilzomib between the years 2013 and 2016 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked databases. Renal failure was defined using the corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes and procedure codes for dialysis. Patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of renal failure were excluded to distinguish an adverse event from comorbidity. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify the variables independently associated with the development of renal failure among MM patients utilizing carfilzomib. A total of 1950 patients were included in the analysis. Renal failure developed in 22% of patients during the study period. The median time to development of renal failure from first carfilzomib administration was 1.6 months (range < 0.1-23.3). Increasing age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.01 per year, p = 0.018), pre-existing heart failure (aHR 1.50, p = 0.005), and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (aHR 2.00, p < 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of developing renal failure. Renal failure occurred in up to 22% of patients on carfilzomib therapy. The exact cause and mechanism of renal failure cannot be determined from our study and may be multifactorial. Future studies are needed to further understand the cause of renal failure among patients on carfilzomib and devise strategies to mitigate the risk.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Patients who develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, either myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML), have a poor prognosis. An earlier Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) analysis of 868 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCTs) performed between 1990 and 2004 showed a 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 22% and 21%, respectively. Modern supportive care, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have led to improved outcomes. Therefore, the CIBMTR analyzed 1531 allo-HCTs performed in adults with t-MDS (n = 759) or t-AML (n = 772) between and 2000 and 2014. The median age was 59 years (range, 18 to 74 years) for the patients with t-MDS and 52 years (range, 18 to 77 years) for those with t-AML. Twenty-four percent of patients with t-MDS and 11% of those with t-AML had undergone a previous autologous (auto-) HCT. A myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen was used in 49% of patients with t-MDS and 61% of patients with t-AML. Nonrelapse mortality at 5 years was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30% to 37%) for patients with t-MDS and 34% (95% CI, 30% to 37%) for those with t-AML. Relapse rates at 5 years in the 2 groups were 46% (95% CI, 43% to 50%) and 43% (95% CI, 40% to 47%). Five-year OS and DFS were 27% (95% CI, 23% to 31%) and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%), respectively, for patients with t-MDS and 25% (95% CI, 22% to 28%) and 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%), respectively, for those with t-AML. In multivariate analysis, OS and DFS were significantly better in young patients with low-risk t-MDS and those with t-AML undergoing HCT with MAC while in first complete remission, but worse for those with previous auto-HCT, higher-risk cytogenetics or Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and a partially matched unrelated donor. Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure, with little improvement seen over the past 2 decades. These data mandate caution when recommending allo-HCT in these conditions and indicate the need for more effective antineoplastic approaches before and after allo-HCT.Copyright © 2021

N2  - In the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic era, the number of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantations (HCTs) with peripheral blood (PB) grafts increased significantly compared with HCTs with bone marrow (BM) grafts, which may be associated with adverse outcomes. We compared outcomes of HCT in BM graft and PB graft recipients age >=18 years with hematologic malignancies who underwent T cell- replete haploidentical HCT and received graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among the 264 patients, 180 (68%) received a BM graft and 84 (32%) received a PB graft. The median patient age was 50 years in both groups. The majority (n = 199; 75%) received reduced-intensity conditioning. The rate of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was higher in the BM graft recipients compared with the PB graft recipients (85% [n = 152] versus 55% [n = 46]; P < .01). The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and the incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were comparable in the 2 groups. Among the patients with grade II-IV aGVHD, the rate of steroid-refractory aGVHD was 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 18%) in the BM group versus 32% (95% CI, 19% to 54%) in the PB group (hazard ratio [HR], 3.7, 95% CI, 1.5 to 9.3; P = .006). At 1 year post-HCT, the rate of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 8% (95% CI, 4% to 13%) in the BM group versus 22% (95% CI, 14% to 36%) in the PB group (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.6; P = .005), and the rate of systemic therapy-requiring cGVHD was 2.5% (95% CI, 1% to 7%) versus 14% (95% CI, 7% to 27%), respectively (HR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7 to 18; P = .004). The PB group had a significantly higher risk of bacterial and viral infections, with no appreciable advantage in the duration of hospitalization, immune reconstitution, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, or survival. Our data suggest a benefit of the use of BM grafts over PB grafts for haplo-HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Background: PEG-asparaginase is critical in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy but is highly immunogenic. Severe allergic reactions lead to substitution of further PEG-asparaginase with Erwinia. Erwinia is associated with more frequent dosing, increased expense, and limited availability. Premedication may reduce rates of allergic reactions. Procedures: This Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three strategies: premedication plus therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), TDM alone, and no premedication or TDM. We modeled two scenarios: a standard-risk (SR) B-ALL patient receiving two asparaginase doses and a high-risk (HR) patient receiving seven asparaginase doses. The model incorporated costs of asparaginase, premedication, TDM and clinic visits, and lost parental wages associated with each additional Erwinia dose. We incorporated a five-year time horizon with a societal perspective. Outcomes were Erwinia substitutions avoided and differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses evaluated model uncertainty. Result(s): In both scenarios, premedication was the least costly strategy. In SR and HR scenarios, premedication with monitoring resulted in 8% and 7% fewer changes to Erwinia compared with monitoring alone and 3% and 2% fewer changes compared with no premedication/monitoring, respectively. Premedication resulted in the most QALYs gained in the SR patients. Individual variation of model inputs did not change premedication/monitoring favorability for either scenario. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, premedication/monitoring was favored in >87% of iterations in both scenarios. Conclusion(s): Compared with other strategies, premedication use and asparaginase level monitoring in children with B-ALL is potentially cost-saving.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - We evaluated standard-of-care (SOC) treatment with or without midostaurin to prevent relapse following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring internal tandem duplication (ITD) in FLT3. Adults (aged 18-70 years) who received alloHSCT in first complete remission, had achieved hematologic recovery, and were transfusion independent were randomized to receive SOC with or without midostaurin (50 mg twice daily) continuously in twelve 4-week cycles. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) 18 months post-alloHSCT. Sixty patients were randomized (30/arm); 30 completed all 12 cycles (midostaurin + SOC, n = 16; SOC, n = 14). The estimated 18-month RFS (95% CI) was 89% (69-96%) in the midostaurin arm and 76% (54-88%) in the SOC arm (hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.12-1.86]; P = 0.27); estimated relapse rates were 11% and 24%, respectively. Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation to <70% of baseline (achieved by 50% of midostaurin-treated patients) was associated with improved RFS. The most common serious adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Rates of graft-vs-host disease were similar between both arms (midostaurin + SOC, 70%; SOC, 73%). The addition of midostaurin maintenance therapy following alloHSCT may provide clinical benefit in some patients with FLT3-ITD AML.

N2  - Pneumococcal (PC) vaccination is recommended for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, response to vaccines has been investigated in a small series of CLL patients. We analyzed the antibody response and outcomes of 112 CLL patients who received the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). An immune response was defined by a twofold increase in the PC-IgG levels assessed by ELISA. The median age of patients was 68 years, 23.2% showed IgG levels <= 400 mg/L, 6.3% progressive disease, 52% unmutated IGHV. Twenty-two (19.6%) patients were treatment-naive and 90 (80.4%) previously treated (40.2% front-line chemoimmunotherapy; ibrutinib first/advanced-line, 9.8%/21.4%; idelalisib advanced-line, 8.9%). Nine (8%) patients developed an immune response, eight treatment-naive, and one on front-line ibrutinib. No responses were observed in patients previously treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Age >= 60 years (p = 0.007), IgG levels < 400 mg/L (p < 0.0001), prior treatment (p < 0.0001), and signs of disease progression (p = 0.04) were associated with a lower response rate. Pneumonia-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with clinical signs of progressive disease (HR, 8.39), prior pneumonia (HR, 7.03), and TP53 disruption (HR, 2.91). In conclusion, our results suggest that vaccination should be offered at diagnosis to CLL patients with early stage and stable disease who have better resources for an effective immune response.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - To prevent early death, management of coagulopathy is important in patients with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This study aimed to clarify factors associated with in-hospital death in patients with coagulopathy during induction therapy for APL. We retrospectively identified patients with newly diagnosed APL who received induction therapy including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and developed coagulopathy, using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. Of 1115 eligible patients, 175 (15%) died at a median of 13 days (interquartile range, 7-30) after admission. In the multivariable analysis, compared with younger patients (aged < 40 years), the occurrence of in-hospital death was significantly more common among older patients (aged >= 40 and < 60 years: odds ratio = 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.29-5.19]; aged >= 60 and < 80 years: 7.66 [3.89-15.10]; aged >= 80 years: 16.83 [7.41-38.21]). Delayed initiation of ATRA and no conventional chemotherapy were significantly associated with in-hospital death (1.79 [1.16-2.76] and 2.40 [1.47-3.92], respectively). A total of 699 patients (63%) received anticoagulant therapies, but none of these was significantly associated with lower mortality. Although the present study was constrained by a lack of laboratory findings because of database limitations, the results showed that untreated patients with APL, especially the elderly, had a poor prognosis. Immediate administration of ATRA may reduce in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - We conducted a randomised phase II study to determine the optimal dose and schedule of melphalan, prednisone, and bortezomib (MPB) (jRCTs031180097). Transplant-ineligible untreated multiple myeloma patients were randomised to Arm A (twice weekly bortezomib in one six-week cycle followed by eight five-week cycles of four times once weekly bortezomib with melphalan and prednisolone on days 1-4) or Arm B (nine four-week cycles of three times once weekly bortezomib with melphalan and prednisolone on days 1-4). The primary end-point was complete response (CR) rate. Of 91 patients randomised to two arms, 88 were eligible. The median cumulative bortezomib doses were 45.8 and 35.1 mg/m2, CR rate was 18.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4-33.4] and 6.7% (95% CI 1.4-18.3), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 and 1.4 years in Arms A and B [hazard ratio (HR) 1.93 (95% CI 1.09-3.42)], respectively. Frequent grade >=3 haematologic toxicities in Arms A and B were neutropenia (64.4% vs. 28.3%) and thrombocytopenia (35.6% vs. 10.9%). Grade 2/3 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 24.4/2.2% in Arm A and 8.7/0% in Arm B. In conclusion, Arm A was the more promising regimen, suggesting that the twice weekly schedule of bortezomib in the first cycle and higher cumulative dose of both bortezomib and melphalan influences the efficacy of modified MPB.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a major cause of morbidity/mortality worldwide, overstressing health systems. Multiple myeloma (MM) patients show an increased risk for infections and they are expected to be particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we have obtained a comprehensive picture of the impact of COVID-19 in MM patients on a local and a global scale using a federated data research network (TriNetX) that provided access to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from Health Care Organizations (HCO) all over the world. Through propensity score matched analyses we found that the number of new diagnoses of MM was reduced in 2020 compared to 2019 (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.96) and the survival of newly diagnosed MM cases decreased similarly (HR 0.61, 0.38-0.81). MM patients showed higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 2.09, 1.58-2.76) and a higher excess mortality in 2020 (difference in excess mortality 9%, 4.4-13.2) than non-MM patients. By interrogating large EMR datasets from HCO in Europe and globally, we confirmed that MM patients have been more severely impacted by COVID-19 pandemic than non-MM patients. This study highlights the necessity of extending preventive measures worlwide to protect vulnerable patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting social distancing and an intensive vaccination strategies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the 20q deletion [del(20q)] may cause deletion of the ASXL1 gene. We studied 153 patients with MDS and del(20q) to assess the incidence, prognostic value and impact on response to azacitidine (AZA) of ASXL1 chromosomal alterations and genetic mutations. Additionally, in vitro assay of the response to AZA in HAP1 (HAP1WT) and HAP1 ASXL1 knockout (HAP1KN) cells was performed. ASXL1 chromosomal alterations were detected in 44 patients (28.5%): 34 patients (22%) with a gene deletion (ASXL1DEL) and 10 patients (6.5%) with additional gene copies. ASXL1DEL was associated with a lower platelet count. The most frequently mutated genes were U2AF1 (16%), ASXL1 (14%), SF3B1 (11%), TP53 (7%) and SRSF2 (6%). ASXL1 alteration due to chromosomal deletion or genetic mutation (ASXL1DEL/ASXL1MUT) was linked by multivariable analysis with shorter overall survival [hazard ratio, (HR) 1.84; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 1.11-3.04; P = 0.018] and a higher rate for acute myeloid leukaemia progression (HR 2.47; 95% CI: 1.07-5.70, P = 0.034). ASXL1DEL/ASXL1MUT patients were correlated by univariable analysis with a worse response to AZA. HAP1KN cells showed more resistance to AZA compared to HAP1WT cells. In conclusion, ASXL1 alteration exerts a negative impact on MDS with del(20q) and could become useful for prognostic risk stratification and treatment decisions.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Hypomethylating agents (HMA) with venetoclax is a new standard for older/unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it is unknown how HMA with venetoclax compare to intensive chemotherapy (IC) in patients who are "fit" or "unfit" for IC. We compared outcomes of older patients with newly diagnosed AML receiving 10-day decitabine with venetoclax (DEC10-VEN) vs IC. DEC10-VEN consisted of daily venetoclax with decitabine 20 mg/m2 for 10 days for induction and decitabine for 5 days as consolidation. The IC cohort received regimens containing cytarabine >=1 g/m2/d. A validated treatment-related mortality score (TRMS) was used to classify patients at high-risk or low-risk for TRM with IC. Propensity scores were used to match patients to minimize bias. Median age of the DEC10-VEN cohort (n = 85) was 72 years (range 63-89) and 28% patients were at high-risk of TRM with IC. The comparator IC group (n = 85) matched closely in terms of baseline characteristics. DEC10-VEN was associated with significantly higher CR/CRi compared to IC (81% vs 52%, P <.001), and lower rate of relapse (34% vs 56%, P =.01), 30-day mortality (1% vs 24%, P <.01), and longer overall survival (OS; 12.4 vs 4.5 months, HR = 0.48, 95%CI 0.29-0.79, P <.01). In patients at both at high-risk and low-risk of TRM, DEC10-VEN showed significantly higher CR/CRi, lower 30-day mortality, and longer OS compared to IC. Patients at both high-risk and low-risk of TRM had comparable outcomes with DEC10-VEN. In conclusion, DEC10-VEN offers better outcomes compared to intensive chemotherapy in older patients with newly diagnosed AML, particularly in those at high-risk of TRM.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) provides prognostic information in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the utility of MRD with venetoclax-based lower intensity regimens is unknown. We analyzed the prognostic value of achieving a negative MRD in older/"unfit" patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. MRD was evaluated in bone marrow specimens using multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Ninety-seven patients achieving either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or morphologic leukemia-free state were included. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 68-78 years), and 64% had adverse-risk AML. Eighty-three patients achieved CR/CRi, and 52 (54%) became MRD negative. Median time to becoming MRD negative was 2.0 months (interquartile range, 0.9-3.1 months). Patients becoming MRD negative by 2 months had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those remaining MRD positive (median RFS, not reached vs 5.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.78; P 5 .004), longer event-free survival (EFS) (median EFS, not reached vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P, .001), as well as longer overall survival (OS) (median OS, 25.1 vs 7.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P, .001). Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had longer OS compared with those with an inferior response (median OS, 25.1 vs 11.6 months; HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58; P, .0005). Patients becoming MRD negative within 1 month had an improved OS compared with MRD-positive patients (median OS, 25.1 vs 3.4 months; HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.64; P, .0001). Differential impact of MRD status on survival outcomes persisted at a later 4-month time point of evaluation. In conclusion, MRD-negative status at 1, 2, and 4 months after starting therapy confers significantly better survival in older/unfit patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03404193.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in multiple myeloma is controversial. We analyzed the results of 205 patients transplanted in one center during 2000-2017. Transplantation was performed on 75 patients without a previous autologous SCT (upfront-allo), on 74 as tandem transplant (auto-allo), and on 56 patients after relapse. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 years for upfront-allo, 11.2 years for auto-allo, and 3.9 years for the relapse group (p = 0.015). Progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4, 2.4, and 0.9 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Non-relapse mortality at 5 years was 8% overall, with no significant difference between the groups. Post-relapse survival was 4.1 years for upfront-allo and auto-allo, and 2.6 years for the relapse group (p = 0.066). Survival of high-risk patients was reduced. In multivariate analysis, the auto-allo group had improved OS and chronic graft-versus-host disease was advantageous in terms of PFS, OS, and relapse incidence. Late relapses occurred in all groups. Allo-SCT resulted in long-term survival in a small subgroup of patients. Our results indicate that auto-allo-SCT is feasible and could be considered for younger patients in the upfront setting.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - There are a limited number of studies comparing outcomes of busulfan (BU)-based myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using unmanipulated haploidentical donors (HIDs), HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUDs), and HLA-matched sibling related donors (MSDs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with complete remission (CR) status. With this background, we compared outcomes among 377 cases of CR following consecutive HID-HSCT for AML (CR) to 86 MUD and 92 MSD-HSCT cases. All patients received BU-based myeloablative conditioning and an unmanipulated graft within the same period. The median patient age was 23 years (range 1.1 to 65 years), and 230 patients (41.4%) were under age18. Among the 555 patients, 432 (77.8%) were of intermediate cytogenetic risk and 123 (22.2%) were of adverse risk. A total of 113 patients (20.5%) had FLT3-ITD+ AML, 425 patients (76.6%) were in first complete remission (CR1) post-transplant, and 130 (23.4%) patients were in second CR (CR2). GVHD prophylaxis included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclosporine-A (CSA) with short-term methotrexate (MTX) for HID, and MUD-HSCT. MMF is not used for MSD-HSCT. The median survival follow-up time was 42 months (range 18-91 months). The 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts was 73.8% +/- 4.8%, 66.4% +/- 8.5%, 74.5% +/- 2.4%, respectively (P = 0.637). Three-year overall survival (OS) was 74.9% +/- 2.4%, 81.8% +/- 4.3%, and 77.5% +/- 4.5% among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts, respectively (P = 0.322). There were no difference among the relapse rate among the HID, MUD, and MSD donor cohorts (14.3% +/- 4.0% vs 20.3% +/- 6.4% vs 14.5% +/- 2.2, respectively; P = 0.851) or the non-relapse mortality (NRM) (12.3% +/- 3.5% vs 9.5% +/- 3.2% vs 14.0% +/- 1.8%, respectively; P = 0.441). Multivariate analyses showed that MRD-positive pre-HSCT was the only risk factor associated with a lower OS and LFS and higher risk of relapse among all 555 patients. Compared with the use of a MUD or MSD, an HID for HSCT had similar outcomes among AML patients with CR states who underwent an allo-HSCT with BU-based myeloablative conditioning. MFC-MRD-positive pre-HSCT was an independent negative factor impact on outcomes for AML patients in CR. We conclude that for AML patients who do not have a MSD or if an urgent transplant is required, HSCT from an HID is a valid option.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - HLA-matching largely contributes to unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (UD-HCT) success but, due to the selective deletion of alloreactive T-cells, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) could modulate its negative impact on outcomes. We retrospectively compared acute leukemia patients receiving 10/10 or 9/10 HLA allele-matched UD-HCT with PTCy-GvHD prophylaxis between 2010 and 2017, reported to EBMT registry. The 100-day incidence of grade >=2 and grade >=3 aGvHD were comparable for 10/10 and 9/10 UD (28% versus 28%, p = 0.8 and 10% versus 8%, p = 0.5, respectively). The 2-year cGvHD and extensive cGvHD were similar between 10/10 and 9/10 UD (35% versus 44%, p = 0.2 and 21% versus 20%, p = 0.6, respectively). The 2-year nonrelapse mortality was 20% after 10/10 and 16% after 9/10 UD-HCT (p = 0.1). Relapse incidence at 2-year was 24% for 10/10 and 28% for 9/10 UD-HCT (p = 0.4). Leukemia-free survival at 2-year was the same for 10/10 and 9/10 UD (56 and 56%, p = 0.6, respectively), with comparable overall survival (62 and 59%, p = 0.9, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed no effect of HLA-matching on outcomes. An advanced disease status and patient disability remained the most important factors portending a worse survival. PTCy could alleviate the detrimental effect of HLA-allele mismatching in UD-HCT, potentially expanding the donor pool for acute leukemia patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who lack a matched sibling or unrelated donor commonly undergo transplantation from a donor matched at 9/10 HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 alleles, and it is unclear if a specific locus mismatch is preferable to any other. We therefore studied 937 patients with AML in complete remission transplanted using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen from an unrelated donor mismatched at a single allele. In a multivariate analysis, patient age, adverse karyotype and patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity were correlated with decreased leukaemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). There was no significant difference in LFS or OS between patients transplanted from donors mismatched at HLA-A, -B, -C or -DRB1 in comparison to a HLA-DQB1 mismatched transplant. In a multivariate analysis, patients transplanted with a HLA-A mismatched donor had higher rates of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) than patients transplanted with a HLA-DQB1 mismatched donor. Patient CMV seropositivity was associated with an increase in NRM and acute GVHD and reduced LFS and OS, regardless of donor CMV status. For CMV seropositive patients lacking a fully matched donor, alternative GVHD and CMV prophylaxis strategies should be considered.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Relapse is a major cause of treatment failure in Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a new pre-emptive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) strategy on relapse in Ph+ALL patients with complete remission undergoing allo-HCT. Pre-emptive TKIs initiation was based on BCR/ABL molecular monitoring. TKIs choice was based on BCR/ABL mutations. Donor lymphocyte infusion was recommended in those with poor response to TKIs. Prophylactic TKIs from historical data were as control. The primary endpoint was relapse. One hundred and sixty-seven Ph+ALL patients were enrolled in this study, including 103 in the pre-emptive group and 64 in the prophylactic group. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 11% and 31% in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups (P = 0.001), respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 87% and 66% (P = 0.001), and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 83% and 61% (P = 0.000), respectively, in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the pre-emptive strategy was the protective factor for relapse, OS, and LFS (P = 0.005, P = 0.005, and P = 0.003, respectively). Our data suggest that this new pre-emptive TKIs strategy based on BCR/ABL molecular monitoring might reduce relapse and improve survival for Ph+ALL patients undergoing allo-HCT.

N2  - Variation in normal blood cells during chemotherapy has not been recognised as a risk factor guiding chemotherapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This study aims to explore whether variations in normal haematopoiesis determine prognosis as well as to improve risk-stratified treatment in childhood ALL. A retrospective study of 279 cases of ALL treated with the CCCG-ALL-2015 regimen in the Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, from May 2015 to January 2017 was performed to analyse the prognostic impact of blood cell levels on day 19 of induction therapy by Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with childhood ALL with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <= 90 cells/mul, absolute monocyte count (AMC) <= 10 cells/mul or absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <= 1000 cells/mul on day 19 of induction therapy had a lower event-free survival (EFS) rate than those with higher values (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that ANC <= 90 cells/mul and ALC <= 1000 cells/mul were independent adverse prognostic factors (HR = 1.981 and 2.162, respectively, both P < 0.05). Among patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) < 1% on day 19 of induction therapy, those with ANC <= 90 cells/mul had lower EFS than those with ANC > 90 cells/mul (70.8 +/- 6.1% vs 86.4 +/- 3.1%, P = 0.001). In the subgroup with the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, patients with ANC <= 90 cells/mul on day 19 of induction therapy also had lower EFS than those with ANC > 90 cells/mul (34.4 +/- 25.2% vs 25.0 +/- 21.7%, P = 0.041). ANC and ALC during induction therapy are independent prognostic factors for childhood ALL. ANC contributes to guiding the prognosis of patients with low-level MRD or the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - CPX-351, a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine in a synergistic 1:5 molar ratio, is approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). In a pivotal phase 3 study, patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed, high-risk/secondary AML were randomized to receive CPX-351 or conventional 713 chemotherapy. In the primary endpoint analysis, CPX-351 demonstrated significantly prolonged median overall survival (OS) vs 713. These exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses evaluated the impact of achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery (CRi) with CPX-351 (73/153 [48%]) vs conventional 713 (52/56 [33%]) on outcomes. CPX-351 improved median OS vs 713 in patients who achieved CR or CRi (25.43 vs 10.41 months; hazard ratio 5 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.31, 0.77). Improved median OS was seen across AML subtypes (t-AML, AML-MRC), age subgroups (60 to 69 vs 70 to 75 years), patients with prior hypomethylating agent exposure, and patients who did not undergo transplantation. Patients who achieved CR or CRi with CPX-351 also had a higher rate of transplantation, a longer median OS landmarked from the date of transplantation (not reached vs 11.65 months; hazard ratio 5 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.21, 0.89), and a safety profile that was consistent with the known safety profile of 713. These results suggest deeper remissions may be achieved with CPX-351, leading to improved OS. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01696084.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Background: Letermovir prophylaxis is currently the standard of care for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, drug-drug interactions between letermovir and azoles or calcineurin inhibitors and the high financial burden of letermovir remain problematic, especially in resource-limited countries. It has not been clarified whether a lower dose of valganciclovir would constitute an effective strategy for CMV prevention in patients with acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT. Method(s): We retrospectively assessed 84 consecutive adult patients with acute leukemia who underwent allo-HSCT. These 84 patients were stratified into a valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 20) and a non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 64). Result(s): Patients in the valganciclovir prophylaxis group had a lower possibility of CMV DNAemia at week 14 after allo-HSCT than those in the non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (15.0% versus 50.0%; p = 0.012). The cumulative incidence of CMV DNAemia at week 14 was also lower in patients with valganciclovir CMV prophylaxis than in those without (15.0% versus 50.4%; p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis validated these data, showing that a low dose of valganciclovir significantly reduced the risk of CMV DNAemia at week 14 by 88% (hazard ratio: 0.12; 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42; p = 0.001). However, these two groups had similar overall survival rates at week 48 (75.0% versus 76.6%; p = 0.805). Four of 20 (20%) patients discontinued valganciclovir prophylaxis because of adverse events. Conclusion(s): Low-dose valganciclovir prophylaxis could be an alternative to letermovir to prevent CMV infection in allo-HSCT, especially in resource-limited countries.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic value of bone marrow (BM) imaging pattern and other imaging findings assessed by 18F-FDG PET-CT in multiple myeloma(MM) and to find out the image interpretation cut-off to define different BM tracer uptake pattern. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively studied PET-CT examinations and clinical data of 100 healthy individuals and 172 newly diagnosed MM patients. A BM uptake > liver SUVmean was selected as the positivity cut-off of pathological uptake in BM after comparing BM uptake in normal control and MM patients. With this interpretation cut-off, we defined the BM FDG uptake pattern as four types: normal, focal, diffuse, and mixed. The clinical correlation and prognostic value of BM uptake pattern were evaluated. The findings were validated in an independent prospective cohort with 72 MM patients. Result(s): In MM cohort, 34.9% patients had focal BM uptake pattern, 3.5% had diffuse pattern, 38.4% had mixed pattern, and 23.3% had normal BM uptake. Diffuse/mixed pattern was correlated with clinical and imaging parameters indicating high tumor burden, and inferior progression free survival (PFS; 3-year-PFS 26.8%) and overall survival (OS; 3-year-OS 50.6%). BM uptake pattern was an independent prognostic factor and diffuse/mixed pattern was associated with inferior OS (P = 0.037, HR 7.16) and PFS (P = 0.015, HR 7.77). The prognostic value of BM uptake pattern was also confirmed in validation set. Conclusion(s): We propose an FDG uptake higher than liver as the positivity cut-off to discriminate between physiological and pathological uptake in BM and defined four BM FDG uptake pattern. BM FDG uptake pattern is a reliable prognostic predictor of MM.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Measurable residual disease (MRD) status is widely adopted in clinical trials in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Findings from FILO group trials (CLL2007FMP, CLL2007SA, CLL2010FMP) enabled investigation of the prognostic value of high-sensitivity (0.7 x 10-5) MRD assessment using flow cytometry, in blood (N = 401) and bone marrow (N = 339), after fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)-based chemoimmunotherapy in a homogeneous population with long follow-up (median 49.5 months). Addition of low-level positive MRD < 0.01% to MRD >= 0.01% increased the proportion of cases with positive MRD in blood by 39% and in bone marrow by 27%. Compared to low-level positive MRD < 0.01%, undetectable MRD was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) when using blood (72.2 versus 42.7 months; hazard ratio 0.40, p = 0.0003), but not when using bone marrow. Upon further stratification, positive blood MRD at any level, compared to undetectable blood MRD, was associated with shorter PFS irrespective of clinical complete or partial remission, and a lower 5-year PFS rate irrespective of IGHV-mutated or -unmutated status (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, high-sensitivity (0.0007%) MRD assessment in blood yielded additional prognostic information beyond the current standard sensitivity (0.01%). Our approach provides a model for future determination of the optimal MRD investigative strategy for any regimen.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Even in the era of PCR-based monitoring, prophylaxis, and preemptive therapy, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a relevant cause of non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, studies using binary analysis (presence/absence of CMV) reported contradicting data for NRM, overall survival and leukemia relapse. Here, we analyzed CMV replication kinetics in 11 508 whole blood PCR samples of 705 patients with HCT between 2012 and 2017. Using two independent models based on CMV peak titers and on the time point of first CMV reactivation, we stratified patients into risk cohorts. Each cohort had distinct cellular immune reconstitution profiles and differentiated for relevant clinical outcomes. Patients with high CMV peak titers had significantly reduced overall survival (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.53-2.96; p <.0001), due to high NRM. Early impaired T cell reconstitution was a risk factor for high CMV peak titers, however relevant CMV viremia also related to boosted T cell reconstitution. Importantly, intermediate CMV peak titers associated with a significantly reduced relapse probability (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.91; p =.022). In short, CMV kinetics models distinguished relevant clinical outcome cohorts beyond the R+ serostatus with distinct immune reconstitution patterns and resolve in part contradicting results of previous studies exclusively focused on the presence or absence of CMV.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - In recent years, treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved substantially, leading to longer survival. This has necessitated a greater focus on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), but data are lacking. In a part-prospective, part-retrospective study, we enrolled 219 adults with ALL in France to assess the impact of key disease and treatment characteristics on HRQoL. Overall HRQoL and most specific QoL domain scores were consistently better among patients receiving front-line therapy, those currently in complete remission, and those who had previously received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Furthermore, HRQoL was consistently impaired in patients with minimal residual disease present (MRD+). In multivariate analyses, multiple lines of therapy, MRD+, leukopenia, comorbidities, and anemia were significantly associated with impaired HRQoL. This study provides real-world data on HRQoL in adults with ALL in France and shows the positive impact of MRD-negative status on HRQoL.Copyright © 2021 Amgen (France) SAS.

N2  - Remoteness is associated with worse survival in adults with cancer. We aimed to determine whether remoteness is associated with cancer outcomes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Canadian children with ALL entered in the CYP-C registry were included. The predictive impact of remoteness on overall survival (OS), relapse, and treatment-related complications (infections, thrombosis, bleeding, and osteonecrosis) was estimated using multivariate regression models. We included 1383 children, of whom 277 (20.0%) lived remotely (>200 km from the pediatric oncology center). The median latency to see a pediatric oncologist was longer in children living remotely. The 5-year OS (95% CI) was similar for both groups (remote: 95.2% [93.7-96.3%] vs close: 94.1% [90.5-95.2%]). No difference was found in the relapse rate between both groups and in treatment-related complications. Remoteness did not affect survival in pediatric ALL. Further research is needed to determine which models of healthcare organization optimize cancer outcomes and patients' satisfaction.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - We evaluated the outcomes of 168 patients undergoing delayed or second autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) from 2010 to 2019. Overall, 21% (n = 35) patients had received a prior transplant and 69% (n = 116) underwent transplant at first relapse. Overall, 27% patients had high-risk cytogenetics and 15% had ISS stage III disease. Stem cell collection was performed after relapse in 72% and 35% of patients received maintenance therapy. Median PFS from salvage treatment and transplant were 28 and 19 months, respectively. Median OS from salvage treatment and transplant was 69 and 55 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that ASCT in first relapse was associated with superior PFS (HR 0.63, p = 0.03) and OS (HR 0.59, p = 0.04) compared to later lines of therapy. In addition, PFS of >=36 months with prior therapy was associated with improved PFS (HR 0.62, p = 0.04) and OS (HR 0.41, p = 0.01). Ninety-five patients underwent delayed transplant at first relapse, median PFS and OS from start of therapy was 30 and 69 months, and median OS from diagnosis was 106 months. These data may serve as a guide when counseling patients undergoing ASCT for relapsed MM and provide a benchmark in designing clinical trials of transplantation/comparative treatments for relapsed MM.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - We evaluated 79 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) >=70 years referred to our blood and marrow transplant clinic, within 1 year of diagnosis from 2010 to 2019, for consideration of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Thirty-eight (48%) of 79 patients underwent ASCT. ASCT was not pursued in 41 (52%) patients due to: patient or physician preference in 80% (n = 33) or ineligibility in 20% (n = 8). Baseline characteristics of patients in the two groups were similar. Median PFS from treatment start amongst patients undergoing ASCT (n = 38) vs. not (n = 41) was 41 months vs. 33 months, p = 0.03. There was no difference in OS, with estimated 5-year OS of 73% vs. 83%, respectively (p = 0.86). Day +100 transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 0%. ASCT was an independent favorable prognostic factor for PFS in multivariate analysis, after accounting for HCT-CI score, performance status, hematologic response, and maintenance. Finally, patients >=70 years undergoing ASCT had similar PFS compared to a contemporaneous institutional cohort of patients <70 years (n = 631) (median PFS from transplant: 36 vs. 47 months, p = 0.25). In this retrospective analysis, ASCT was associated with low TRM and better PFS in fit older adults with MM compared to non-transplant therapy, with comparable benefits as seen in younger patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a debilitating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). A retrospective review of 845 patients who underwent HCT was conducted. Cumulative incidence of AVN was 6.3% at 4 years. The following risk factors were significantly associated with AVN risk on univariate analysis: age < 45 (p=0.004), moderate to severe chronic GvHD (p<0.001), reduced intensity conditioning (p=0.02), and a diagnosis of acute leukemia (p=0.045). Multivariate analysis confirmed two risk factors: younger age (<45 years), 9.0% vs 4.4% (p=0.011, hazard ratio (HR) 2.134), and moderate-severe chronic GvHD, 15.4% vs 2.1% (p<0.001, HR 4.950). A risk score model was generated assigning a score to each risk factor. A score of 1 was assigned to moderate-severe GvHD or those with age <45. Total score was calculated, thus dividing patient into three groups: low (score 0, n=349, 41.3%), intermediate (score 1, n=379, 44.9%), and high risk (score 2; n=116, 13.7%). This risk score could stratify the patients according to AVN risk (p<0.001). The risk of AVN was 1.5% in the low risk, 6.2% in the intermediate risk, and 20.8% in the high risk groups. Moderate-severe chronic GvHD and younger age (<45 years) are key risk factors for AVN following allogeneic HCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The prospective randomized, placebo-controlled CALGB 10603/RATIFY trial (Alliance) demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit from the addition of midostaurin to standard frontline chemotherapy in a genotypically-defined subgroup of 717 patients with FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The risk of death was reduced by 22% on the midostaurin-containing arm. In this post hoc analysis, we analyzed the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) on this study and also evaluated the impact of 12 4-week cycles of maintenance therapy. CIR analyses treated relapses and AML deaths as events, deaths from other causes as competing risks, and survivors in remission were censored. CIR was improved on the midostaurin arm (HR = 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54-0.93); p = 0.01), both overall and within European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk classification subsets when post-transplant events were considered in the analysis as events. However, when transplantation was considered as a competing risk, there was overall no significant difference between the risks of relapse on the two randomized arms. Patients still in remission after consolidation with high-dose cytarabine entered the maintenance phase, continuing with either midostaurin or placebo. Analyses were inconclusive in quantifying the impact of the maintenance phase on the overall outcome. In summary, midostaurin reduces the CIR.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) is standard treatment for elderly patients with multiple myeloma (MM). In this randomized phase 3 study, we investigated efficacy and feasibility of dose/schedule-adjusted Rd followed by maintenance at 10 mg per day without dexamethasone (Rd-R) vs continuous Rd in elderly, intermediate-fit newly diagnosed patients with MM. Primary end point was event-free survival (EFS), defined as progression/death from any cause, lenalidomide discontinuation, or hematologic grade 4 or nonhematologic grade 3 to 4 adverse event (AE). Of 199 evaluable patients, 101 received Rd-R and 98 continuous Rd. Median follow-up was 37 months. EFS was 10.4 vs 6.9 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.95; P = .02); median progression-free survival, 20.2 vs 18.3 months (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55-1.10; P = .16); and 3-year overall survival, 74% vs 63% (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37-1.03; P = .06) with Rd-R vs Rd, respectively. Rate of >=1 nonhematologic grade >=3 AE was 33% vs 43% (P = .14) in Rd-R vs Rd groups, with neutropenia (21% vs 18%), infections (10% vs 12%), and skin disorders (7% vs 3%) the most frequent; constitutional and central nervous system AEs mainly related to dexamethasone were more frequent with Rd. Lenalidomide was discontinued for AEs in 24% vs 30% and reduced in 45% vs 62% of patients receiving Rd-R vs Rd, respectively. In intermediate-fit patients, switching to reduced-dose lenalidomide maintenance without dexamethasone after 9 Rd cycles was feasible, with similar outcomes to standard continuous Rd. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02215980.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Background: Daunorubicin and cytarabine are used as standard induction chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. CPX-351 is a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a synergistic 1:5 molar ratio. Primary analysis of the phase 3 trial in adults aged 60-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia provided support for approval of CPX-351 by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. We describe the prospectively planned final 5-year follow-up results. Method(s): This randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done across 39 academic and regional cancer centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 60-75 years and had a pathological diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia according to WHO 2008 criteria, no previous induction therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 (stratified by age and acute myeloid leukaemia subtype) to receive up to two induction cycles of CPX-351 (100 units/m2 administered as a 90-min intravenous infusion on days 1, 3, and 5; on days 1 and 3 for the second induction) or standard chemotherapy (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days plus intravenous daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 [7+3]; cytarabine for 5 days and daunorubicin on days 1 and 2 for the second induction [5+2]). Patients with complete remission or complete remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery could receive up to tw cycles of consolidation therapy with CPX-351 (65 units/m2 90-min infusion on days 1 and 3) or chemotherapy (5+2, same dosage as in the second induction cycle). The primary outcome was overall survival analysed in all randomly assigned patients. No additional adverse events were collected with long-term follow-up, except data for deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01696084, and is complete. Finding(s): Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 11, 2014, 309 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive CPX-351 (153 patients) or 7+3 (156 patients). At a median follow-up of 60.91 months (IQR 60.06-62.98) in the CPX-351 group and 59.93 months (59.73-60.50) in the 7+3 group, median overall survival was 9.33 months (95% CI 6.37-11.86) with CPX-351 and 5.95 months (4.99-7.75) with 7+3 (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.91). 5-year overall survival was 18% (95% CI 12-25%) in the CPX-351 group and 8% (4-13%) in the 7+3 group. The most common cause of death in both groups was progressive leukaemia (70 [56%] of 124 deaths in the CPX-351 group and 74 [53%] of 140 deaths in the 7+3 group). Six (5%) of 124 deaths in the CPX-351 group and seven (5%) of 140 deaths in the 7+3 group were considered related to study treatment. Interpretation(s): After 5 years of follow-up, the improved overall survival with CPX-351 versus 7+3 was maintained, which supports the previous evidence that CPX-351 can contribute to long-term remission and improved overall survival in patients aged 60-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia.

N2  - CD+1 T cells orchestrate immune responses and are actively engaged in shaping tumor immunity. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling controls the epigenetic tuning of CD+1 T-cell differentiation and polarization, and perturbed STAT signaling networks in CD+1 T cells subvert antitumor immunity in malignancies. Azacitidine (AZA), the mainstay therapy for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS), affects CD+1 T-cell polarization and function, but whether this contributes to AZA efficacy is currently unknown. By using functional proteomic, transcriptomic, andmutational analyses in 73 HR-MDS patients undergoing AZA therapy, we demonstrate that responding patients exhibited a coordinated CD+1 T-cell immune response and downregulated the inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in CD+1 T cells after AZA, in contrast to nonresponders who upregulated the same pathways. We further observed an AZA-mediated downregulation of intereukin-6 (IL-6)- induced STAT3 phosphorylation in CD+1FOXP32 conventional T cells (Tcons) that correlated independently with better response and survival, whereas it was also not associated with the mutation number and profile of the patients. The AZA-induced downregulation of IL-6/STAT3 axis in Tcons restored the STAT signaling architecture in CD+1 T-cell subsets, whereas STAT signaling networks remained disorganized in patients who upregulated IL-6/STAT3 activity in Tcons. Given the pivotal role of CD+1 T cells in adaptive immunity, our findings suggest that the downregulation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in Tcons potentially constitutes a previously unrecognized immune-mediatedmechanism of action of AZA and sets the scene for developing rational strategies of AZA combinations with IL-6/STAT3 axis inhibitors.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - We compared the transplant outcomes of adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by high hyperdiploidy (HeH; 51-65 chromosomes) (n = 29) and those with a normal karyotype (n = 87) by propensity score-matched analysis. There were no significant differences among groups in 3-year probabilities of overall survival (OS, 63.5% vs. 55.3%, p =.553), cumulative relapse incidence (28.6% vs. 28.7%, p =.982), and non-relapse mortality (10.9% vs. 21.4%, p =.303). Three-year OS was significantly worse in HeH patients with third or later complete remission (CR) or non-CR compared with those in first CR (19.0% vs. 69.9%, p =.010). Frequently gained chromosomes +21 (75.9%), +4 (69.0%), +6 (69.0%), +10 (69.0%), and +1 (69.0%) had no significant prognostic impact on the OS of patients with HeH in multivariate analyses. Patients with HeH who may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be further analyzed.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - We report a retrospective analysis of 110 unselected pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated during 2015-2017 in a charity-funded public institution in Cambodia with a reduced intensity ALL-Moscow Berlin (MB)-91 protocol. No patient abandoned treatment. Sixty-three patients (57%) were high risk (HR). Seventy-two patients (65.5%) reached complete remission (CR) on day 36. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 34.9% (50.5% for standard risk [SR]). Most deaths resulted from infections (40 [53.3%]) and bleeding (15 [20%]). With further selective reduction of treatment intensity and access to platelet infusion, leukemia therapy is justified in this setting.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - In the phase 3 ENDEAVOR study, carfilzomib-dexamethasone (Kd) improved survival over bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), regardless of baseline renal function. This real-world study compared renal response in patients with RRMM (1-3 prior lines) and renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate #50 mL/min) treated with Kd vs Vd. Electronic medical records data from the Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records database were assessed (from January 2012 through February 2018). Time to renal response (defined according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for renal overall response (ROR) and renal complete response (RCR) using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for baseline covariates. Included were 543 Kdtreated and 1005 Vd-treated patients. In line 2 (2L), compared with Vd, Kd achieved significantly higher ROR (51.4% vs 39.6%; P <.0001) and RCR (26.6% vs 22.2%; P =0229). After baseline covariate adjustment, 2L patients receiving Kd vs Vd were 45% more likely to achieve ROR (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18-1.78), and 68% were more likely to achieve RCR (IRR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.24-2.28). The renal response benefit with Kd remained consistent in 2L to line 4 (4L). In a combined analysis of patients receiving Kd and Vd (2L and 2L-4L), renal responders had longer overall survival and time to next treatment than renal nonresponders. These results demonstrate improved real-world effectiveness of Kd over Vd in RRMM renal rescue, and the positive association between renal response and improved survival.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and KIR-ligand (KIRL) interactions play an important role in natural killer cell-mediated graft versus leukemia effect (GVL) after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for AML. Accounting for known KIR-KIRL interactions may identify donors with optimal NK cell-mediated alloreactivity and GVL. A retrospective study of 2359 donor-recipient pairs (DRP) who underwent unrelated donor (URD) HCT for AML was performed. KIR-KIRL combinations were determined and associations with clinical outcomes examined. Relapse risk was reduced in DRP with both higher inhibitory KIR-KIRL (iKIR) and missing KIRL (mKIR) scores, with HR 0.86 (P = 0.01) & HR 0.84 (P = 0.02) respectively. The iKIR and mKIR score components were summed to give a maximal inhibitory KIR ligand (IM-KIR) score for each donor, which if it was 5, as opposed to <5, was also associated with a lower relapse risk, SHR 0.8 (P = 0.004). All IM = 5 donors possess KIR Haplotype B/x. Transplant-related mortality was increased among those with IM-KIR = 5, HR, 1.32 (P = 0.01). In a subset analysis of those transplanted with 8/8 HLA-matched DRP, anti-thymocyte globulin recipients with IM-KIR = 5, had a lower relapse rate HR, 0.61 (p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that HLA-matched unrelated donors with the highest inhibitory KIR content confer relapse protection, albeit with increased TRM. These donors all have KIR haplotype B. Clinical trials utilizing donors with a higher iKIR content in conjunction with novel strategies to reduce TRM should be considered for URD HCT in recipients with AML to optimize clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Moxetumomab pasudotox is a recombinant CD22-targeting immunotoxin. Here, we present the long-term follow-up analysis of the pivotal, multicenter, open-label trial (NCT01829711) of moxetumomab pasudotox in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Method(s): Eligible patients had received >= 2 prior systemic therapies, including >= 2 purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs), or >= 1 PNA followed by rituximab or a BRAF inhibitor. Patients received 40 microg/kg moxetumomab pasudotox intravenously on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day cycle for up to six cycles. Disease response and minimal residual disease (MRD) status were determined by blinded independent central review. The primary endpoint was durable complete response (CR), defined as achieving CR with hematologic remission (HR, blood counts for CR) lasting > 180 days. Result(s): Eighty adult patients were treated with moxetumomab pasudotox and 63% completed six cycles. Patients had received a median of three lines of prior systemic therapy; 49% were PNA-refractory, and 38% were unfit for PNA retreatment. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the durable CR rate (CR with HR > 180 days) was 36% (29 patients; 95% confidence interval: 26-48%); CR with HR >= 360 days was 33%, and overall CR was 41%. Twenty-seven complete responders (82%) were MRD-negative (34% of all patients). CR lasting >= 60 months was 61%, and the median progression-free survival without the loss of HR was 71.7 months. Hemolytic uremic and capillary leak syndromes were each reported in <= 10% of patients, and <= 5% had grade 3-4 events; these events were generally reversible. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion(s): Moxetumomab pasudotox resulted in a high rate of durable responses and MRD negativity in heavily pre-treated patients with HCL, with a manageable safety profile. Thus, it represents a new and viable treatment option for patients with R/R HCL, who currently lack adequate therapy.

N2  - Pretransplant measurable residual disease (MRD) has been shown to be associated with relapse incidence following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it remains less clear whether pretransplant MRD status affects transplant outcomes in core binding factor AML (CBF-AML). We retrospectively evaluated the effect of pretransplant MRD, which was measured by a polymerase chain reaction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts, on transplant outcomes for a cohort of 959 adult patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML treated by allogeneic HCT during complete remission (CR), between 2000 and 2018. Multivariate analysis showed the absence of pretransplant MRD was significantly associated with lower relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P < 0.001), treatment failure (HR, 0.66; P = 0.004), and overall mortality (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) among patients with t(8;21). However, pretransplant MRD negativity was not associated with relapse (HR, 0.73; P = 0.420), treatment failure (HR, 0.64; P = 0.063), or overall mortality (HR, 0.69; P = 0.149) among patients with inv(16). In subgroup analysis, pretransplant MRD status significantly affected relapse and LFS only in patients with t(8;21) undergoing allogeneic HCT during CR2. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the different prognostic values of pretransplant MRD for CBF-AML, highlighting the need to develop effective therapeutic strategies for such MRD-positive patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative post-remission therapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission (CR). The availability of alternative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donors, such as cord blood and haploidentical related donors, could allow patients to receive allogeneic HCT who are without an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The use of these alternative donors is preferable for patients with advanced disease due to the rapid availability. However, comparative data for cord blood transplantation (CBT) and haploidentical related donor transplantation (haplo-HCT) are limited for adult patients with AML in CR. We sought to compare overall survival (OS); leukemia-free survival (LFS); graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS); and chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (CRFS) between single-unit CBT (SCBT) and haplo-HCT recipients for adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR. We retrospectively analyzed and compared the results of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in 1313 adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR who received either SCBT (n = 1102) or unmanipulated haplo-HCT (n = 211) between 2007 and 2018 in Japan. Among the whole cohort, the cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet recovery were significantly lower in SCBT recipients compared with those in haplo-HCT recipients (P < .001 for neutrophil, P < .001 for platelet). SCBT was significantly associated with a higher incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD and lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD compared to haplo-HCT (P = .013 for grades II to IV acute GVHD; P = .006 for extensive chronic GVHD). Haplo-HCT recipients developed a higher incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia compared to SCBT recipients (P = .004). In the multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences for grades III or IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI],. 88 to 1.57; P = .26), relapse incidence (HR, 1.09; 95% CI,. 76 to 1.58; P = .61), non-relapse mortality (HR,. 83; 95% CI,. 58 to 1.18; P = .32), OS (HR,. 92; 95% CI,. 70 to 1.20; P = .56), LFS (HR,. 94; 95% CI,. 73 to 1.21; P = .67), GRFS (HR, 1.12; 95% CI,. 90 to 1.40; P = .27), or CRFS (HR, 1.15; 95% CI,. 92 to 1.44; P = .19) between the two donor types. In the propensity score matching analysis, which identified 180 patients in each cohort, there were no significant differences in transplant outcomes between the two donor types, except for delayed neutrophil (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P < .001) and a higher incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD (P = .052) in SCBT. SCBT and unmanipulated haplo-HCT had similar survival outcomes for adult patients with AML in CR despite the lower hematopoietic recovery and higher grade II to IV acute GVHD in SCBT recipients and the higher CMV antigenemia in haplo-HCT recipients.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Most patients of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) require red blood cell (RBC) or platelet transfusion during their disease courses, which could cause an increased risk of iron overload and alloimmunization. However, it remains less clear whether pretransplantation RBC or platelet transfusion burden affects transplant outcomes in patients with MDS. The objective was to examine the significance of pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burden on transplant outcomes after allogeneic HCT for adults with de novo MDS. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of pretransplantation RBC or platelet transfusion burden on transplant outcomes in a cohort of 1007 adult patients with de novo MDS treated by upfront allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) between 2006 and 2018. Both higher pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burdens were significantly associated with higher overall mortality and relapse-related mortality, but not non-relapse mortality in the multivariate analysis. Higher pretransplantation RBC transfusion burden was also significantly associated with lower neutrophil, platelet, and reticulocyte recovery in the multivariate analysis. In summary, our study clearly demonstrated that a higher pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burden was independently associated with higher overall mortality, relapse-related mortality, and lower hematopoietic recovery after allogeneic HCT for de novo MDS. Early allogeneic HCT should be considered for patients with de novo MDS who require RBC and platelet transfusion repeatedly.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care for higher risk MDS (HR-MDS) patients. The current dogma is to begin HMA therapy in all HR-MDS patients at the time of initial diagnosis. We investigated the impact of the timing of HMA initiation among HR-MDS patients presenting with adequate blood counts to discern the possible benefit of early treatment based solely on disease risk. We identified 320 HR-MDS patients with adequate hematopoiesis who were treated with HMA. The complete response rates were 21%, 26%, 23%, and 7% respectively for patients treated within 30, 31-60, 61-90, and more than 90 days from time of diagnosis (p=.046). The median OS from the date of diagnosis was 641, 550, 979, and 806 days, respectively (p=.2). A delay in initiating HMA therapy in HR-MDS patients with adequate blood counts is not associated with worsened outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a poor risk factor for outcome. gammadelta T cells represent a unique minority lymphocyte population that is preferentially located in peripheral tissues, can recognize antigens in a non-MHC-restricted manner, and plays a "bridging" role between the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this study, we investigated a potential graft-versus-leukemia effect of gammadelta T cell reconstitution post-transplantation in AML patients with pretransplantation positive MRD status (MRD+). MRD assessment was performed in 202 patients using multicolored flow cytometry ("different from normal" strategy); 100 patients were deemed MRD+. Analysis for absolute concentrations of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, natural killer, and gammadelta T cells were performed by flow cytometry according to an internal protocol at day +30 and +100 post-transplantation. Differences between categorical and continuous variables were determined using the chi-square and Student t test, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare medians of continuous variables. Spearman's correlation was used for nonparametric assessment of correlation between different cell subsets during immune reconstitution. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the associations between immune reconstitution and survival outcomes. Gray's analysis was used to compute incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The median follow-up of survivors was 28 months (range 3 to 59 months). Younger age (<=58 years) of recipient and donor (<30 years), sex mismatch, use of a matched donor, cytomegalovirus reactivation, and administration of antithymocyte globulin were associated with a faster gammadelta T cell reconstitution. In multivariable analysis for MRD+ patients, a higher than median level of gammadelta T cells on days +30 and +100 resulted in significantly improved leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42 [P =.007] and 0.42 [P =.011], respectively) and overall survival (HR, 0.44 [P =.038] and 0.33 [P =.009], respectively). Furthermore, a higher gammadelta T cell level on day +30 was associated with a significantly reduced risk of relapse (HR, 0.36; P =.019). No impact of gammadelta T cell level on relapse at days +30 and +100 could be seen in MRD-negative patients, and no correlation with occurrence of GVHD was observed. Our data indicate that enhanced immune reconstitution of gammadelta T cells post-transplantation may overcome the higher relapse risk of pretransplantation MRD+ status in patients with AML.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Complex karyotype, defined as >=3 cytogenetic abnormalities, is prognostic of survival in patients treated with ibrutinib or venetoclax in relapsed/refractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent studies re-evaluating this dichotomous variable have shown that higher numbers of cytogenetic abnormalities (ie, >=5) have a worse overall survival in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. We sought to determine if increasing karyotypic complexity, treated as a continuous variable, was prognostic of survival for patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody at our institution. We included 456 patients with both treatment-naive and RR disease. Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-13), 30% of patients had presence of del(17p), and 75% expressed unmutated IGHV. Fifty percent had >=3 cytogenetic abnormalities, including 30% with >=5. In a multivariable analysis, increasing karyotypic complexity was an independent predictor of shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.10; P < .0001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.12; P < .0001). Furthermore, we found that presence of clonal evolution determined by cytogenetic analysis at progression was prognostic of subsequent survival (P = .02). This solidifies karyotypic complexity as an important prognostic factor for patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. Further research should consider sequential karyotypic analysis as a determination of risk of progression and death in patients with CLL.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Central venous catheters (CVCs) are generally required for chemotherapy in patients with acute leukemia, but catheter-related infection is one of the common causes of neutropenic fever. We investigated the in-hospital mortality according to early removal of CVCs and the factors influencing the mortality in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. This study retrospectively analyzed the hospital record data of 278 patients with acute leukemia treated with non-tunneled CVCs and remission induction chemotherapy in a single institution. Bloodstream infection was more common (p < 0.0001) and median peak C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after neutropenic fever were significantly higher (23.3 vs. 14.5 mg/dl, p = 0.003) in the group with early removal than in the group with maintenance of the CVC. Multivariate analysis of the patients revealed a significant decrease in the mortality with female gender (odds ratio (OR): 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.54, p = 0.002) and a significant increase in the mortality according to the peak CRP (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17, p < 0.0001). By contrast, early removal of the CVC had no significant effect on the mortality (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.54-2.47, p = 0.706) in univariate analysis. Furthermore, subsequent bloodstream infection after clinical decision for maintenance or early removal of the CVC was confirmed more frequently in the group with early removal (early removal, 22.6%; maintenance, 7.6%, p < 0.0001). Early removal of the CVC had no benefit regarding the mortality and prophylaxis of bloodstream infection in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. Therefore, maintaining a CVC for as long as possible may be considered, if catheter-related bloodstream infection is not strongly suspected.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Both total body irradiation (TBI)-based and chemotherapy only-based myeloablative transplantation conditioning regimens have been applied, but the optimal regimen remains unclear. We performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy of TBI-based versus chemotherapy only-based myeloablative conditioning regimens. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and meeting abstracts for all studies comparing TBI-based and chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL. Two authors independently reviewed all studies for inclusion and extracted data related to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Eight studies were included in the final analysis. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was optimal. TBI-based regimens showed evidence of benefit compared with chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in terms of relapse (relative risk [RR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.94; 6 studies, 5091 patients), OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89; 7 studies, 4727 patients), and PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.85; 7 studies, 4727 patients). The TBI-based regimen did not increase the likelihood of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.36; 5 studies, 4996 patients) or chronic GVHD (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21; 5 studies, 4490 patients), or NRM (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.28; 6 studies, 4522 patients). However, TBI-based regimens were associated with an increased risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.63; 3 studies, 3675 patients). A subgroup comparison of patients age >=16 years showed similar results. This systematic review represents evidence supporting the use of TBI-based conditioning regimen in patients undergoing allo-HCT for ALL who are candidates for myeloablative conditioning, as it offers better OS, PFS, and less relapse with acceptable NRM.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

We compared overall survival (OS) using registry data from the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) involving 455 adults who received a second allo-HCT from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 320) or a haploidentical (n = 135) donor. Eligibility criteria required adults aged >=18 years who received a second allo-HCT for treating AML relapse between 2005 and 2019. The primary end-point was OS. There was no statistically significant difference in the median (interquartile range) age between the groups, MUD 46 (35-58) versus haploidentical 44 (33-53) years (P = 0.07). The median OS was not different between the MUD and the haploidentical groups (10 vs. 11 months, P = 0.57). Similarly, the 2-year OS was 31% for the MUD and 29% for the haploidentical donor groups. The OS was worse if the procedure was performed with active AML [hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.89; P = 0.02]. Conversely, a longer time from first allo-HCT to relapse (>13.2 months) was associated with better OS (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.69; P < 0.0001). The results of the present analysis limit the ability to recommend one donor type over another when considering a second allo-HCT for relapsed AML. Our findings highlight that best OS is achieved when receiving the second allo-HCT in complete remission.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - We determined the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in preventing grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia undergoing matched sibling donor (MSD) or volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) allogeneic stem cell transplantation after myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning across 5 Australian centers. A total of 145 patients (50 MSD, 95 VUD) were randomly assigned to placebo or TCZ on day -1. All patients received T-cell-replete peripheral blood stem cell grafts and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporin/methotrexate. A planned substudy analyzed the VUD cohort. With a median follow-up of 746 days, the incidence of grade 2-4 aGVHD at day 100 for the entire cohort was 36% for placebo vs 27% for TCZ (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-1.26; P = .23) and 45% vs 32% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.31-1.22; P = .16) for the VUD subgroup. The incidence of grade 2-4 aGVHD at day 180 for the entire cohort was 40% for placebo vs 29% for TCZ (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38-1.22; P = .19) and 48% vs 32% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.30-1.16; P = .13) for the VUD subgroup. Reductions in aGVHD were predominantly in grade 2 disease. For the entire cohort, transplant-related mortality occurred in 8% vs 11% of placebo-treated vs TCZ-treated patients, respectively (P = .56), and overall survival was 79% vs 71% (P = .27). Median day to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was delayed by 2 to 3 days in TCZ-treated patients, whereas liver toxicity and infectious complications were similar between groups. In this phase 3 randomized double-blind trial, TCZ showed nonsignificant trends toward reduced incidence of grade 2-4 aGVHD in recipients from HLA-matched VUDs but no improvements in long term-survival.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite B-cell receptor-targeted inhibitors revolutionizing treatment. This suggests that other signaling molecules are involved in disease escape mechanisms and resistance. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a promising candidate that is activated by unmethylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide-DNA. Here, we show that plasma from patients with CLL contains significantly more unmethylated DNA than plasma from healthy control subjects (P <.0001) and that cell-free DNA levels correlate with the prognostic markers CD38, beta2-microglobulin, and lymphocyte doubling time. Furthermore, elevated cell-free DNA was associated with shorter time to first treatment (hazard ratio, 4.0; P =.003). We also show that TLR9 expression was associated with in vitro CLL cell migration (P <.001), and intracellular endosomal TLR9 strongly correlated with aberrant surface expression (sTLR9; r = 0.9). In addition, lymph node-derived CLL cells exhibited increased sTLR9 (P =.016), and RNA-sequencing of paired sTLR9hi and sTLR9lo CLL cells revealed differential transcription of genes involved in TLR signaling, adhesion, motility, and inflammation in sTLR9hi cells. Mechanistically, a TLR9 agonist, ODN2006, promoted CLL cell migration (P <.001) that was mediated by p65 NF-kappaB and STAT3 transcription factor activation. Importantly, autologous plasma induced the same effects, which were reversed by a TLR9 antagonist. Furthermore, high TLR9 expression promoted engraftment and rapid disease progression in a NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgammanull mouse xenograft model. Finally, we showed that dual targeting of TLR9 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) was strongly synergistic (median combination index, 0.2 at half maximal effective dose), which highlights the distinct role for TLR9 signaling in CLL and the potential for combined targeting of TLR9 and BTK as a more effective treatment strategy in this incurable disease.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia is a common complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of early-onset EBV viremia in acute leukemia (AL) patients who underwent allo-HSCT with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-containing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Two hundred and ninety-six patients were included between January 2013 and December 2015. In 126 patients (42.6%) who developed early-onset EBV viremia, with a median time of 48 (range 18~99) days after allo-HSCT. The cumulative incidence of EBV viremia at 30 and 90 days after allo-HSCT were 4.1 and 39.9%, respectively. Prognostic analysis showed that the adjusted overall survival in early-EBVpos group was significantly lower than early-EBVneg group within the first 26.7 months after allo-HSCT [hazard ratio (HR), 1.63, P = 0.012], but significantly higher than those afterward (after 26.7 months: HR 0.11, P = 0.035); for the adjusted event-free survival, early-EBVpos group was significantly inferior in early-EBVpos group within the first 10.8 months after transplantation (HR: 1.55, P = 0.042), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after 10.8 months (HR: 0.58, P = 0.107). Compared with early-EBVneg group after adjusting by aGVHD and CMV viremia, HR for death from transplant-related mortality was 2.78-fold higher in patients with early-EBV viremia in piecewise constant Cox analysis (P = 0.006), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after the cut-point time (HR: 0.67, P = 0.361). No differences in terms of relapse and relapse mortality were observed between early-EBVpos and early-EBVneg group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the impacts on transplant outcomes of early-EBV viremia were time-dependent, which may help to optimize management strategies for early-EBV viremia after allo-HSCT, especially in AL patients with ATG-containing MAC regimen.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) t(8;16)(p11;p13)/MYST3-CREBBP is a very rare abnormality. Previous small series suggested poor outcome. We report on 59 patients with t(8;16) within an international, collaborative study. Median age was 52 (range: 16-75) years. AML was de novo in 58%, therapy-related (t-AML) in 37% and secondary after myelodysplastic syndrome (s-AML) in 5%. Cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype in 43%. Besides MYST3-CREBBP, whole-genome sequencing on a subset of 10 patients revealed recurrent mutations in ASXL1, BRD3, FLT3, MLH1, POLG, TP53, SAMD4B (n = 3, each), EYS, KRTAP9-1 SPTBN5 (n = 4, each), RUNX1 and TET2 (n = 2, each). Complete remission after intensive chemotherapy was achieved in 84%. Median follow-up was 5.48 years; five-year survival rate was 17%. Patients with s-/t-AML (P = 0.01) and those with complex karyotype (P = 0.04) had an inferior prognosis. Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) was performed in 21 (36%) patients, including 15 in first complete remission (CR1). Allo-HCT in CR1 significantly improved survival (P = 0.04); multivariable analysis revealed that allo-HCT in CR1 was effective in de novo AML but not in patients with s-AML/t-AML and less in patients exhibiting a complex karyotype. In summary, outcomes of patients with t(8;16) are dismal with chemotherapy, and may be substantially improved with allo-HCT performed in CR1.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Carfilzomib (CFZ) improves survival in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma but is associated with cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs). We prospectively investigated the effect of CFZ on endothelial function and associations with CVAEs. Forty-eight patients treated with Kd (CFZ 20/56 mg/m2 and dexamethasone) underwent serial endothelial function evaluation, using brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and 26S proteasome activity (PrA) measurement in PBMCs; patients were followed until disease progression or cycle 6 for a median of 10 months. FMD and PrA decreased acutely after the first dose (p < 0.01) and FMD decreased at cycles 3 and 6 compared to baseline (p <= 0.05). FMD changes were associated with CFZ-induced PrA changes (p < 0.05) and lower PrA recovery during first cycle was associated with more prominent FMD decrease (p = 0.034 for group interaction). During treatment, 25 patients developed Grade >=3 CVAEs. Low baseline FMD (HR 2.57 lowest vs. higher tertiles, 95% CI 1.081-6.1) was an independent predictor of CVAEs. During treatment, an acute FMD decrease >40% at the end of first cycle was also independently associated with CVAEs (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.29-11.83). Kd treatment impairs endothelial function which is associated with PrA inhibition and recovery. Both pre- and posttreatment FMD predicted CFZ-related CVAEs supporting its role as a possible cardiovascular toxicity biomarker.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndromes show a male predominance and men with MDS/MPN have worse outcomes, but it is unknown if the mutational burden differs between genders. We reviewed 167 patients with MDS/MPN and found that men had worse overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-3.75; P = 0.013] independent of subtype, Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score and age at diagnosis. We analysed the genomic data of a subset of 100 patients. Men had 0.88 more somatic mutations on average (95% CI 0.20-1.56, P = 0.011) independent of subtype, sample source and blast percentage. More somatic mutations was associated with a higher incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (subdistribution HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.70; P = 0.046). Men had 0.70 more mutations in high-risk genes [additional sex combs like-1 (ASXL1), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), stromal antigen 2 (STAG2)] on average (95% CI 0.11-1.29, P = 0.021), and 13-times higher odds of harbouring an EZH2 mutation (95% CI 1.64-102.94, P = 0.015). The presence of an EZH2 mutation was associated with worse survival among men (HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.1-8.0; P = 0.031). Our present findings suggest that the worse outcomes in men with MDS/MPN are associated with a higher number of somatic mutations, especially in high-risk genes. These results warrant validation in larger cohorts and investigation of the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - We assessed event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival in 676 incident cases of childhood Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin (NHL) lymphoma actively registered in Greece (1996-2019). HL-OS5-year was 96% and NHL-OS5-year 85%, whereas HL-EFS5-year was 86% and NHL-EFS5-year was 81%, notably similar to the respective OS rates (HL: 95%, NHL: 85%) in developed countries. For HL, older age at diagnosis, high maternal education and close proximity to treatment centers were linked to remarkably favorable outcomes. By contrast, stage IV patients showed worse OS and EFS. HL patients with low levels of hemoglobin were associated with worse EFS (hazard ratio: 2.81, 95% confidence intervals: 1.09-7.22). OS (76%) and EFS (73%) were poor among high-risk NHL patients and those with increased LDH (71%). The identified predictors of poor disease outcome point to the need for intensification of individualized treatments. Ongoing clinical cancer registration entailing clinical components could contribute to use of state-of-the-art treatments.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Several studies have suggested that estrogens have a protective function against lymphomagenesis. The treatment of breast cancer is driven by subtype classification, and the assessment of hormone receptor status is important for treatment selection. Thus, we evaluated the association between breast cancer and the incidence of NHL. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a population-based nationwide registry in South Korea. We selected all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer between January 1st, 2002 and December 31st, 2016 who received curative treatment (N = 84,969) and a 1:10 sample of age-matched non-breast cancer controls (N = 1,057,674). Incident breast cancer (time-varying exposure) was the exposure and development of any type of NHL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mature T/NK-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and unspecified types of NHL, was the outcome. During follow-up, 1564 incident cases of NHL occurred. The fully adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) for NHL associated with the development of breast cancer was 1.64 (95% CI = 1.34-2.00) after adjusting for body mass index, alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, income, and comorbidity. The adjusted HR for NHL was much higher in participants who were aged <50 years and who received hormone therapy (either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) than in those >=50 years or who did not receive hormone therapy, respectively. The development of breast cancer was associated with a significantly increased risk of NHL, particularly follicular lymphoma and mature T/NK-cell lymphoma. In particular, the risk of NHL was higher in patients receiving hormone therapy and in younger patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Observational studies with long-term follow-up of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are scarce. Patient data over a period of four decades were retrospectively analysed from databases at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, UK. The cohort was delineated by two distinct therapeutic eras; the first from 01/01/1982 to 31/12/2010 (n = 147) and the second 01/01/2011 to 31/07/2020 (n = 125). The median age at diagnosis was significantly older in the second era compared to the first (69 and 65 years respectively, P = 0.003). The 3-, 6- and 12-month overall survival (OS) rates in the second era were significantly higher compared to the first, at 85%, 77%, 62% versus 56%, 49%, 38% respectively (log-rank test P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based induction protocols employed in the second era were associated with improved OS compared to those used in the first [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.57]. Within the second era, superior OS rates were seen with the use of intensive HD-MTX protocols (including consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation) compared to non-intensive HD-MTX schedules (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-0.99). Initiating chemotherapy within 14 days of biopsy and use of rituximab were independently associated with improved OS and progression-free survival during the second era. These data suggest that prompt treatment initiation and use of intensive HD-MTX- and rituximab-based protocols have resulted in improved survival outcomes for patients.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Elevated levels of serum cardiovascular markers including natriuretic peptides (NPs) such as amino terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) have been associated with disease severity and survival in cancer patients and more recently in multiple myeloma (MM). In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed 87 consecutive symptomatic TEMM (transplant-eligible) and 126 TIMM (transplant-ineligible) patients treated at our institution that did undergo NTproBNP testing from 2017 to 2020. Median age at diagnosis was 59.3 years and 75.4 years for the TEMM and TIMM groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). NTproBNP >= 300 ng/L was used to assess survival outcomes in the group of symptomatic MM. Patients with AL amyloidosis and symptomatic MM were excluded from the study. Median OS for patients with NTproBNP >= 300 ng/L was shorter (45.9 months) as compared to those with NTproBNP of < 300 ng/L (non-reached) (p = 0.0001). In addition, OS was shorter for those with CCI > 2, ISS2-3, and high-risk cytogenetics by FISH and >= 70 years of age. Multivariate analysis showed that HR cytogenetics and ISS2-3 were independent predictors for OS in the entire cohort of MM patients. When restricted to TIMM, age >= 80 years and NTproBNP >= 800 ng/L were predictors for OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, NTproBNP appears to be an independent predictor factor for OS in symptomatic TIMM patients. The use of NTproBNP as a frailty marker remains to be elucidated. However, NTproBNP could potentially be used to guide treatment decisions aimed to minimize cardiovascular and renal toxicity for myeloma therapies that potentially do have cardio-renal implications.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Bortezomib-containing regimens (BCRs) represented standard, first-line therapy for transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma (TIMM) in Canada until the introduction of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Ld). However, little comparative data exist to inform the selection of regimens. We assessed the outcomes for TIMM patients treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone or prednisone (CyBorD/P), bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP), bortezomib and dexamethasone or prednisone (VD/P) and lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Ld) using the Canadian Myeloma Research Group database. Of 1156 TIMM patients evaluated, 82% received bortezomib combinations while 18% received Ld. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.0, 21.1, 13.2 and 28.5 months (P = 0.0002) and median overall survival (OS) was 52.0, 63.6, 30.8 and 65.7 months (P < 0.0001) in the CyBorD/P, VMP, VD/P and Ld groups respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS and OS between the two triplet bortezomib regimens (VMP and CyBorD/P). Ld was associated with a longer PFS but not a significantly superior OS to date. Outcomes with the bortezomib-steroid doublet were inferior (VD/P). However, multivariable analysis identified features related to disease biology as the most important prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Such factors, as well as those affecting the physician's choice of regimen, are likely to influence the results observed with different regimens. This study demonstrated real-world outcomes in TIMM similar to those reported in clinical trials.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities are known to influence post-transplant outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but data assessing the prognostic value of combined genetic models in the HCT setting are limited. We developed an adapted European LeukemiaNet (aELN) risk classification based on available genetic data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, to predict post-transplant outcomes in 2289 adult AML patients transplanted in first remission, between 2013 and 2017. Patients were stratified according to aELN into three groups: favorable (Fav, N = 181), intermediate (IM, N = 1185), and adverse (Adv, N = 923). Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in 2-year overall survival (OS) (Fav: 67.7%, IM: 64.9% and Adv: 53.9%; p < 0.001); disease-free survival (DFS) (Fav: 57.8%, IM: 55.5% and Adv: 45.3; p < 0.001) and relapse (Fav: 28%, IM: 27.5% and Adv: 37.5%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis (MVA) revealed no differences in outcomes between the Fav and IM groups, thus they were combined. On MVA, patients in the Adv risk group had the highest risk of relapse (HR 1.47 p <= 0.001) and inferior DFS (HR 1.35 p < 0.001) and OS (HR 1.39 p < 0.001), even using myeloablative conditioning or in those without the pre-HCT measurable-residual disease. Novel approaches to mitigate relapse in this high-risk group are urgently needed.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - To evaluate the efficacy of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) as maintenance therapy in patients with favorable-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this retrospective study enrolled 84 patients with favorable-risk AML: 42 patients who received IFN-alpha maintenance therapy and 42 patients who did not (control). The median follow-up time and duration of IFN-alpha treatment was 26 (6-54) months and 18 (2-24) months, respectively. The 4-year estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) after the last consolidation chemotherapy was 86.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 75.8-97.8%) in the IFN-alpha group and 55.7% (95% CI, 37.2-74.3%) in the control group (p=.007). The 4-year estimated overall survival was 94.4% (95% CI, 86.8-102%) and 76.4% (95% CI, 61.9-90.9%) in IFN-alpha and control groups, respectively (p=.040). The Cox regression analysis showed that IFN-alpha treatment was the only independent factor affecting RFS (p=.004). Maintenance therapy with IFN-alpha may prevent relapse in favorable-risk AML after consolidation chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - This study investigated the relationships between HDL-C and major types of blood cancers. Competing risks regression was used to examine the hazard ratios of hematologic malignancies in 9,596,145 individuals (>=20 years) using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (2009-2017). The incidence of the following hematologic cancers was determined based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision: Multiple Myeloma (MM), Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), Lymphoid Leukemia (LL), and Myeloid Leukemia (ML). During an average of 8.3 years of follow-up (79,179,225 person-years), 15,864 incident hematologic malignancies were identified. Compared to those in the highest HDL-C quartile, subjects in the lowest HDL-C quartile had the highest risk of all hematologic cancers combined (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.31, 1.25-1.37) and of each respective type of blood cancer, as follows: MM (HR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.46-1.76), HL (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.70), NHL (HR 1.12, 95%CI 1.04-1.21), LL (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.16-1.61), and ML (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.45). Low HDL-C level was significantly associated with increased risk of hematologic malignancy, suggesting that a low HDL-C level is an independent risk factor and preclinical marker for hematologic malignancy.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Secondary or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (s/tAML) differs biologically from de novo disease. In general s/tAML patients have inferior outcomes after chemotherapy, compared to de novo cases and often receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for consolidation. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratification system is commonly applied in AML but the clinical significance is unknown in s/tAML. We analyzed 644 s/tAML or de novo AML patients receiving HSCT. s/tAML associated with older age and adverse risk, including higher ELN risk. Overall, s/tAML patients had similar cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), but higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and shorter overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for ELN risk and pre-HSCT measurable residual disease status, disease origin did not impact outcomes. Within the ELN favorable risk group, CIR was higher in s/tAML compared to de novo AML patients likely due to a different distribution of genetic aberrations, which did not translate into shorter OS. Within the ELN intermediate and adverse group outcomes were similar in de novo and s/tAML patients. Thus, not all s/tAML have a dismal prognosis and outcomes of s/tAML after allogeneic HSCT in remission are comparable to de novo patients when considering ELN risk.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Relapse constitutes the greatest threat to event-free survival after completion of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, evidence on optimal follow-up schedules is limited. The aims of the present population-based cohort study were to assess the value of current follow-up schedules after completion of Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL protocol treatment and to estimate the impact of relapse detection mode on overall survival (OS). Among 3262 patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2014 and who completed treatment, 338 developed a relapse. Relapse detection was equally distributed between extra visits (50.8%) and scheduled follow-up visits (49.2%). All cases detected at an extra visit and 64.3% of cases detected at a scheduled visit presented with symptoms or objective findings. Neither the mode of detection {adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.48] for scheduled visits} nor the duration of symptoms was an independent risk factor for OS after relapse. The estimated number of scheduled blood samples needed to diagnose one subclinical relapse during the first 5 years after treatment cessation was 1269 (95% CI 902-1637). In conclusion, based on OS data, scheduled visits after cessation of therapy seem to yield no extra benefit. These results should frame future follow-up strategies.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Background: Adaptive or memory natural killer (NK) cells with epigenetic imprints similar to memory T cells have been shown to develop in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with upregulation of activating receptor NKG2C. These cells have been shown to possess strong anti-tumour efficacy both in-vitro as well as in-vivo. Objective(s): To determine if reconstitution of adaptive NK cells (CD56dimNKG2C+NKG2A-) in patients with advanced leukemia undergoing haploidentical HCT had any impact on disease progression (DP). Study Design: The study cohort comprised of 60 patients with advanced acute leukemia, aged 2-65 years, receiving myeloablative PTCy based haploidentical transplantation from CMV seropositive donors, followed by CTLA4Ig-primed donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). They were evaluated for the kinetics of reconstitution of adaptive NK cells, both phenotypic and functional, at days +30,+60, +90 and at regular intervals, to 3 years of follow-up, in relation to DP. Reconstitution of adaptive NK cells was compared with a retrospective cohort of patients in the same protocol receiving DLI without CTLA4Ig. Result(s): Non-relapse mortality, acute and chronic GVHD were 5.1%, 10.3% and 14.5%. DP was 17.5% at a median follow-up of 28 months. Adaptive NK cells were significantly higher in patients without DP at days+30, +60 and +90 (p = 0.0001), irrespective of CMV reactivation and remained elevated until 36 months post-HCT. These cells maintained their functional competence as measured by robust interferon-gamma production with higher expressions of KIR, NKG2D and CD57, without any increase in PD1 expression. Grafts from donors with higher adaptive NK cells were associated with a lower risk of DP (p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, adaptive NK cell recovery at day +90 had the most favorable impact on DP (HR-0.7). Tregs reconstituted briskly along with the adaptive NK cells and were sustained as well, without compromising the GVL effect. Comparison with a retrospective cohort receiving the same protocol with DLI without CTLA4Ig, showed a superior reconstitution of adaptive NK cells in those receiving CTLA4Ig-DLI (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that myeloablative transplantation from CMV seropositive haploidentical donors augmented with CTLA4Ig-primed DLI might favor early and sustained expansion of functionally competent adaptive NK cells irrespective of CMV reactivation, with a favorable outcome.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Relapse and graft failure after autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are serious and frequently fatal events. A second HSCT can be a life-saving alternative, however, information on the results of such intervention in an outpatient setting is limited. Outpatient second hematoprogenitors transplant after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) at a single academic center was analyzed. Twenty-seven consecutive adults who received an allo-HSCT after an initial auto- or allo-HSCT from 2006 to 2019 were included. Data were compared using the chi2-test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models was performed; cumulative incidence estimation of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was assessed. Hodgkin lymphoma was the most frequent diagnosis for the group with a first auto-HSCT with 5/12 (41.7%) cases, and acute myeloid leukemia for those with a first allo-HSCT with 6/15 (40%). One-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) was 66.7% (95% CI 27.2-88.2) and 59% (95% CI 16-86) for 12 patients with a first auto-HSCT; and for 15 patients with a first allo-HSCT, it was 43.3% (95% CI 17.9-66.5) and 36% (95% CI 13.2-59.9), respectively. Eight (29.6%) patients died of TRM and the cumulative incidence of TRM at 1 year was 22% (95% CI 8.6-39.27). Chronic graft-versus-host disease and late (>10 months) second transplantation were protective factors for longer survival. Neutropenic fever was more common in the group with a first allo-HSCT (p = 0.01). In conclusion, outpatient second allo-HSCT using RIC after auto- or allografting failure or relapse is feasible and offers a reasonable alternative for patients with severe life-threatening hematological diseases.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize academic and adaptive skill outcomes in survivors of high-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR B-ALL). Method(s): Participants were 178 patients enrolled on a nontherapeutic clinical trial that aimed to characterize neurocognitive and functional outcomes (ie, academic achievement and adaptive skills) following treatment for childhood HR B-ALL. Eligible patients were treated on Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 clinical trial that included two treatment randomizations: methotrexate delivery (high or escalating dose) and corticosteroid (dexamethasone or prednisone). Academic achievement and adaptive skills were evaluated at one time point, 8-24 months after completing treatment. Result(s): Multivariable logistic regression showed no significant association between treatment variables and outcomes after accounting for age at diagnosis, sex, and insurance status. In multivariable analyses accounting for sex and insurance status, survivors <10 years old at diagnosis had significantly lower scores in Math (P =.02). In multivariable analyses accounting for sex and age at diagnosis, scores for children with US public health insurance were significantly lower than those with US private or military insurance across all academic and adaptive skills (all P-values <=.04). Results from univariate analyses showed that boys had significantly lower scores than girls across all adaptive skill domains (all P-values <=.04). Conclusion(s): Regardless of treatment randomization, survivors of HR B-ALL <10 years at diagnosis are at risk for deficits in Math and overall adaptive functioning; overall adaptive skills for boys were significantly poorer. Screening and early intervention for patients at highest risk, particularly young patients and lower resourced families, should be prioritized.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - The optimal way to use immunomodulatory drugs as components of induction and maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma is unresolved. We addressed this question in a large phase III randomized trial, Myeloma XI. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (n=2,042) were randomized to induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (CTD) or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (CRD). Additional intensification therapy with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) was administered before autologous stem-cell transplantation to patients with a suboptimal response to induction therapy using a response-adapted approach. After receiving high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, eligible patients were further randomized to receive either lenalidomide alone or observation alone. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The CRD regimen was associated with significantly longer PFS (median: 36 vs. 33 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.96; P=0.0116) and OS (3-year OS: 82.9% vs. 77.0%; HR, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63-0.93; P=0.0072) compared with CTD. The PFS and OS results favored CRD over CTD across all subgroups, including patients with International Staging System stage III disease (HR for PFS, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93; HR for OS, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.56-1.09), high-risk cytogenetics (HR for PFS, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43-0.84; HR for OS, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.42-1.15) and ultra-high-risk cytogenetics (HR for PFS, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.41-1.11; HR for OS, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.34-1.25). Among patients randomized to lenalidomide maintenance (n=451) or observation (n=377), maintenance therapy improved PFS (median: 50 vs. 28 months; HR, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.37-0.60; P<0.0001). Optimal results for PFS and OS were achieved in the patients who received CRD induction and lenalidomide maintenance. The trial was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2009-010956-93) and ISRCTN49407852.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - To design a simple and reproducible classifier predicting the overall survival (OS) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) >=60 years of age treated with 7 + 3, we sequenced 37 genes in 471 patients from the ALFA1200 (Acute Leukemia French Association) study (median age, 68 years). Mutation patterns and OS differed between the 84 patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and the 387 patients with good (n = 13), intermediate (n = 339), or unmeasured (n = 35) cytogenetic risk. TP53 (hazards ratio [HR], 2.49; P = .0003) and KRAS (HR, 3.60; P = .001) mutations independently worsened the OS of patients with poor-risk cytogenetics. In those without poor-risk cytogenetics, NPM1 (HR, 0.57; P = .0004), FLT3 internal tandem duplications with low (HR, 1.85; P = .0005) or high (HR, 3.51; P < 10-4) allelic ratio, DNMT3A (HR, 1.86; P < 10-4), NRAS (HR, 1.54; P = .019), and ASXL1 (HR, 1.89; P = .0003) mutations independently predicted OS. Combining cytogenetic risk and mutations in these 7 genes, 39.1% of patients could be assigned to a "go-go" tier with a 2-year OS of 66.1%, 7.6% to the "no-go" group (2-year OS 2.8%), and 3.3% of to the "slow-go" group (2-year OS of 39.1%; P < 10-5). Across 3 independent validation cohorts, 31.2% to 37.7% and 11.2% to 13.5% of patients were assigned to the go-go and the no-go tiers, respectively, with significant differences in OS between tiers in all 3 trial cohorts (HDF [Hauts-de-France], n = 141, P = .003; and SAL [Study Alliance Leukemia], n = 46; AMLSG [AML Study Group], n = 223, both P < 10-5). The ALFA decision tool is a simple, robust, and discriminant prognostic model for AML patients >=60 years of age treated with intensive chemotherapy. This model can instruct the design of trials comparing the 7 + 3 standard of care with less intensive regimens.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with rearrangement of the lysine methyltransferase 2a gene (KMT2Ar) has adverse outcomes. However, reports on the prognostic impact of various translocations causing KMT2Ar are conflicting. Less is known about associated mutations and their prognostic impact. In a retrospective analysis, we identified 172 adult patients with KMT2Ar AML and compared them to 522 age-matched patients with diploid AML. KMT2Ar AML had fewer mutations, most commonly affecting RAS and FLT3 without significant impact on prognosis, except for patients with >=2 mutations with lower overall survival (OS). KMT2Ar AML had worse outcomes compared with diploid AML when newly diagnosed and at relapse, especially following second salvage (median OS of 2.4 vs 4.8 months, P < 0.0001). Therapy-related KMT2Ar AML (t-AML) had worse outcomes compared with de novo KMT2Ar AML (median OS of 0.7 years vs 1.4 years, P < 0.0001). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) in first remission was associated with improved OS (5-year, 52 vs 14% for no allo-HSCT, P < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, translocation subtypes causing KMT2Ar did not predict survival, unlike age and allo-HSCT. In conclusion, KMT2Ar was associated with adverse outcomes regardless of translocation subtype. Therefore, AML risk stratification guidelines should include all KMT2Ar as adverse.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The availability of alternative donor sources could allow elderly patients to receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of single-unit cord blood transplantation (CBT) in 1577 patients aged >=60 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Japan between 2002 and 2017. In total, 990 (63%) patients were not in complete remission (CR) at the time of CBT. A myeloablative conditioning regimen (52%) and calcineurin inhibitor (CI) + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (45%) were more commonly used. With a median follow-up for survivors of 31 months, the probability of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of leukemia-related mortality at 3 years was 31% and 29%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 3 years were 24% and 41%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days and extensive chronic GVHD at 2 years were 44%, 16%, and 14%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 80% at 42 days. Results of multivariate analysis indicated that the following factors were significantly associated with higher overall mortality: performance status >=1, hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index >=3, adverse cytogenetics, extramedullary disease at diagnosis, and non-CR status at CBT. By contrast, female sex, HLA disparities >=2, mycophenolate mofetil-based GVHD prophylaxis, and recent CBT were significantly associated with lower overall mortality. In conclusion, single CBT offers a curative option for AML patients aged >=60 years with careful patient selection.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), the optimal conditioning regimens have not yet been determined. We conducted a Japanese nationwide, retrospective study to investigate this issue. This study included 914 ATL patients who underwent allo-HCT between 1995 and 2015. In patients aged 55 years or younger, there was no statistically significant difference between reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens regarding risk of relapse (vs. RIC group: MAC group, hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, P = 0.071), non-relapse mortality (vs. RIC group: MAC group, HR 1.38, P = 0.115), or overall mortality (vs. RIC group: MAC group, HR 1.17, P = 0.255). Among RIC regimens, fludarabine plus melphalan-based (Flu/Mel) regimens were associated with a lower risk of relapse (Flu/Mel140 group, HR 0.59, P < 0.001; Flu/Mel80 group, HR 0.79, P = 0.021) than the Flu plus busulfan-based regimen (Flu/Bu2 group). Meanwhile, Flu/Mel140 group had a significantly higher risk of non-relapse mortality (vs. Flu/Bu2 group: HR 1.53, P = 0.025). In conclusion, it is acceptable to select a RIC regimen for younger patients. Moreover, it might be beneficial to select a Flu/Mel-based regimen for patients at high risk of relapse.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Treatment of infants with acute leukemia remains challenging, especially for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Infants have shown markedly higher rates of induction mortality compared with noninfants. There are limited data on presentation acuity and supportive care utilization in this age group. Method(s): In retrospective analyses of patients treated for new onset ALL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at pediatric hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information System, we compared presentation acuity, induction mortality, and resource utilization in infants relative to noninfants less than 10 years at diagnosis. Result(s): Analyses included 10 359 children with ALL (405 infants, 9954 noninfants) and 871 AML (189 infants, 682 noninfants). Infants were more likely to present with multisystem organ failure compared to noninfants for both ALL (12% and 1%, PR = 10.8, 95% CI: 7.4, 15.7) and AML (6% vs. 3%; PR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.7). Infants with ALL had higher induction mortality compared to noninfants, even after accounting for differences in anthracycline exposure and presentation acuity (2.7% vs. 0.5%, HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0, 4.8). Conversely, infants and noninfants with AML had similar rates of induction mortality (3.2% vs. 2.1%, HR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.3, 3.9), which were comparable to rates among infants with ALL. Infants with ALL and AML had greater requirements for blood products, diuretics, supplemental oxygen, and ventilation during induction relative to noninfants. Conclusion(s): Infants with leukemia present with higher acuity compared with noninfants. Induction mortality and supportive care requirements for infants with ALL were similar to all children with AML, and significantly higher than those for noninfants with ALL.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are widely used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), yet identifying those patients unlikely to benefit remains challenging. We assessed response and overall survival (OS) in 247 patients molecularly profiled by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) before first-line HMA therapy, and a subset of 108 patients were sequenced serially during treatment. The most common mutations included TP53 (33.1%), ASXL1 (19%), TET2 (16.5%), DNMT3A (14.1%), and SRSF2 (12.1%). The overall response rate was 42.1%, with the composite TET2-mutant/ASXL1 wild-type genotype representing the strongest predictor of response (overall response rate, 62.1%; complete remission rate, 34.5%). The median OS for the cohort was 15 months, and the number of mutations detected by NGS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; P 5 .02), as well as mutations in TP53 (HR, 2.33; P 5 .001) and EZH2 (HR, 2.41; P 5 .04) were identified as independent covariates associated with inferior OS in multivariable analysis. Serial molecular profiling revealed that clearance of TP53 mutations during HMA therapy was associated with superior OS (HR, 0.28; P 5 .001) and improved outcome in patients proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. These data support baseline molecular profiling by NGS in MDS patients treated with HMAs and provide novel observations of sequential profiling during therapy that provide particular value in TP53-mutated diseaseCopyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important functions in cancer biology. Among them, lncRNA KIAA0125 is one of the genes proposed to play a critical role in leukaemia stem cell (LSC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of the expression levels of lncRNA KIAA0125 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a disease with highly heterogeneous clinical and biological features. Using RNA arrays, we measured the expression of KIAA0125 in 176 primary MDS patients. We found that higher KIAA0125 expression was associated with higher risk MDS, based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), mutations in ASXL1 and NRAS, and predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KIAA0125 expression was an independent, unfavourable prognostic factor for OS and LFS, irrespective of IPSS-R and mutation status. Further global gene expression profile analysis suggested a close association of higher KIAA0125 expressions with LSC signatures. The expression of KIAA0125 may be a potential biomarker to guide the treatment choice in MDS patients, especially those with lower risk subtypes, in whom palliative treatment is usually used.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The etiology of multiple myeloma (MM) remains incompletely understood; however, epidemiologic studies have suggested a possible link between exposure to environmental aromatic hydrocarbons-which serve as exogenous ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which has been implicated in cancer biology-and development of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM. Herein, we demonstrate the functional expression of AHR in MM cell lines and primary human MM samples. AHR is expressed in putative MM 'stem cells' and advanced clinical stages of MM, and functionally contributes to MM tumor cell phenotype and proliferation. Antagonism of AHR directly impairs MM cell viability and increases MM cell susceptibility to immune-mediated clearance. Furthermore, our findings indicate that AHR antagonism may represent an effective means to enhance the function of other drugs, such as anti-CD38 antibodies, in future clinical studies. Taken together, these data identify AHR as a novel target for MM therapy.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: IKZF1deletion is an unfavorable factor in Philadelphia negative (Ph -) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the effects of IKZF1 deletions co-existing genetic alterations in Ph (-) ALL have not been extensively studied. Method(s): Bone marrow samples from 368 children with Ph (-) ALL were analyzed by using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit for detection of gene deletions and Sanger sequencing for mutational analysis of RAS pathway genes. The outcome was analyzed on 215 patients treated with Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-ALL-2002 protocol. Result(s): IKZF1 deletions were present in 12.8% and IKZF1plus in 6.3% of patients. Mutations of RAS pathway genes were detected in 25.0% of IKZF1-deleted patients. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) of IKZF1-undeleted patients was significantly better compared with IKZF1-deleted patients (80.0% vs. 47.8%, p = 0.001). Compared with outcome of patients harboring IKZF1 deletion alone, no difference in EFS was observed in patients with IKZF1plus, whereas three patients carried both IKZF1 and ERG deletions had a superior 10-year EFS (100%). The 10-year EFS of patients with any gene mutation of RAS pathway was worse than that of patients with wild-type genes (79.1% vs. 61.6%, p = 0.033). In multivariate analysis, RAS pathway mutations and IKZF1 deletion were independent predictors of inferior EFS. Co-existence of IKZF1 deletion with RAS pathway mutations had a worst 10-year EFS (11.1 +/- 10.5%) and 10-year OS (53.3 +/- 17.6%). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that RAS pathway mutation is an added-value biomarker in pediatric IKZF1-deleted Ph (-) ALL patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy improves the remission rate of refractory/relapsed B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) patients, but the relapse rate remains high. Recent studies suggest patients who underwent post-chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (post- HSCT) would achieve durable remission and better survival, but this remains controversial. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the role of post-HSCT in R/R B-ALL. The Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed were used to identify relevant studies; the latest search update was on July 05, 2020. We used the Cochran Q test and I-squared statistics to test for heterogeneity among the studies analyzed. The fixed model and random model were used to combine results when appropriate. We performed all statistical analyses with Stata 12, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We included 18 studies with 758 patients in the meta-analysis. Our results indicated that post-HSCT was associated with lower relapse rate (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32-0.50, P = 0.000), better overall survival (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.19-0.71, P = 0.003), better leukemia-free survival (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10-0.40, P = 0.000). However, post-HSCT did not influence OS in Caucasians, and CAR-T cells with CD28 co-stimulation factor bridged to HSCT did not influence OS. Post-HSCT decreased the relapse rate and improved the long-term survival of R/R B-ALL patients. R/R B-ALL patients would benefit from post-HSCT after CAR-T cell therapy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Although chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy produces a high complete remission rate among patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, relapse remains an urgent issue. It is uncertain whether consolidative haploidentical-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is suitable for achieving sustainable remission. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT. Fifty-two patients with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent haplo-HSCT after CAR-T therapy were analyzed. The median time from CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT was 61 days. After a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the 1-year probabilities of event-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse were 80.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.0-90.9), 92.3% (95% CI, 85.0-99.5), and 14.1% (95% CI, 10.7-17.4), respectively, while the corresponding 2-year probabilities were 76.0% (95% CI, 64.2-87.7), 84.3% (95% CI, 74.3-94.3), and 19.7% (95% CI, 15.3-24.0), respectively. No increased risk of 2-year cumulative incidence of graft-versus-host disease, treatment-related mortality, or infection was observed. A pre-HSCT measurable residual disease-positive status was an independent factor associated with poor overall survival (hazard radio: 4.201, 95% CI: 1.034-17.063; P = 0.045). Haplo-HSCT may be a safe and effective treatment strategy to improve event-free survival and overall survival after CAR-T therapy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Pleural effusion (PE) is prevalent in unselected "real-life" populations of multiple myeloma (MM). However, its prognostic value on MM is currently elusive. This study aimed to explore the role of PE on MM prognosis and to develop a novel prognostic nomogram for a cohort of Chinese patients with MM. Patients diagnosed with MM form 2000 through 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. PE was evaluated by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Independent predictors of overall survival (OS) were identified using a multivariable Cox regression model performed on variables selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. A nomogram was constructed based on these variables. The concordance index (C-index) and the calibration curve were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram. Among 861 patients analyzed, 368 patients developed PE. Multivariate cox regression and restricted mean survival time (RMST) analyses revealed that patients with PE experienced worse OS vs. patients without PE. A nomogram predictive of OS was constructed using PE, plasma cell proportion, international staging system (ISS) stage, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 1q21 gain, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The nomogram showed satisfactory discrimination in the derivation cohort (C-index=0.729) and the validation cohort (C-index=0.684), outperforming the Durie-Salmon (DS) and ISS staging systems. Moreover, the nomogram accurately classified patients into two distinct high- and low-risk groups. PE is frequently encountered in the disease course for MM patients. We derivated and validated a novel nomogram for MM based on PE, outperforming the DS/ISS staging systems.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Various models of NK cell alloreactivity have been associated with outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), but results have varied widely. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the context of KIR profiles may further refine their association with transplant outcomes. In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, 81 AML patients who underwent matched-related donor alloHCT were included. Post-HCT outcomes were assessed based on mutational status and KIR profiles with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. On multivariable analysis those with any somatic mutations and C1/C2 heterozygosity had less acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.75; P =.009), more relapse (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.30-7.01; P =.010), inferior relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P =.014), and overall survival (OS; HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P =.015), whereas those with a missing KIR ligand had superior RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94; P =.031). The presence of a somatic mutation and donor haplotype A was also associated with less acute GvHD (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92; P =.032), more relapse (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.13-6.52; P =.025), inferior RFS (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14; P =.030), and OS (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.38; P =.024). Enhanced NK cell alloreactivity from more KIR activating signals (donor B haplotype) and fewer inhibitory signals (recipient missing KIR ligand or C1 or C2 homozygosity) may help mitigate the adverse prognosis associated with some AML somatic mutations. These results may have implications for improving patient risk stratification prior to transplant and optimizing donor selection.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - The predictive value of measurable residual disease (MRD) for survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been firmly established in younger patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. The value of MRD after treatment with decitabine in older patients is unknown. This retrospective analysis included patients >=60 years of age with AML who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) after treatment with decitabine or intensive chemotherapy. Of the 133 consecutively transplanted patients, 109 had available pretransplantation MRD analyses (by flowcytometry [threshold 0.1%]). Forty patients received decitabine treatment (10-day schedule), and 69 patients received intensive chemotherapy (7 + 3 regimen). Patients who received decitabine were older (median 67 versus 64 years) and more often had MRD (70% versus 38%). OS after alloHCT was comparable in both groups. In the chemotherapy group, MRD-positive patients had a significantly higher relapse probability (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 4.81; P=.0031) and risk of death (HR 2.8; P=.02) compared to MRD-negative patients. In the decitabine group there was no significant association between the presence of MRD and relapse (sHR 0.85; P=.83) or death (HR 0.72; P=.60). Pretransplantation MRD in patients receiving decitabine treatment does not have similar predictive value for relapse or survival in older AML patients receiving an alloHCT, compared to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is widely applicable and prognostic prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). We evaluated the prognostic role of clonal hematopoiesis-associated DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (DTA) and non-DTA mutations for MRD monitoring post-alloHCT to refine MRD marker selection. Of 154 patients with AML, 138 (90%) had at least one mutation at diagnosis, which were retrospectively monitored by amplicon-based error-corrected NGS on day 90 and/or day 180 post-alloHCT. MRD was detected in 34 patients on day 90 and/or day 180 (25%). The rate of MRD positivity was similar when DTA and non-DTA mutations were considered separately (17.6% vs 19.8%). DTA mutations had no prognostic impact on cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, or overall survival in our study and were removed from further analysis. In the remaining 131 patients with at least 1 non-DTA mutation, clinical and transplantation-associated characteristics were similarly distributed between MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients. In multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was an independent adverse predictor of cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, and overall survival but not of nonrelapse mortality. The prognostic effect was independent of different cutoffs (above limit of detection, 0.1% and 1% variant allele frequency). MRD log-reduction between diagnosis and post-alloHCT assessment had no prognostic value. MRD status post-alloHCT had the strongest impact in patients who were MRD positive prior to alloHCT. In conclusion, non-DTA mutations are prognostic NGS-MRD markers post-alloHCT, whereas the prognostic role of DTA mutations in the posttransplant setting remains open.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - This analysis from the phase II BRIGHT AML 1003 trial reports the long-term efficacy and safety of glasdegib + low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The multicenter, open-label study randomized (2:1) patients to receive glasdegib + LDAC (de novo, n = 38; secondary acute myeloid leukemia, n = 40) or LDAC alone (de novo, n = 18; secondary acute myeloid leukemia, n = 20). At the time of analysis, 90% of patients had died, with the longest follow-up since randomization 36 months. The combination of glasdegib and LDAC conferred superior overall survival (OS) versus LDAC alone; hazard ratio (HR) 0.495; (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.325-0.752); p = 0.0004; median OS was 8.3 versus 4.3 months. Improvement in OS was consistent across cytogenetic risk groups. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, a survival trend with glasdegib + LDAC was observed in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (HR 0.720; 95% CI 0.395-1.312; p = 0.14; median OS 6.6 vs 4.3 months) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (HR 0.287; 95% CI 0.151-0.548; p < 0.0001; median OS 9.1 vs 4.1 months). The incidence of adverse events in the glasdegib + LDAC arm decreased after 90 days' therapy: 83.7% versus 98.7% during the first 90 days. Glasdegib + LDAC versus LDAC alone continued to demonstrate superior OS in patients with acute myeloid leukemia; the clinical benefit with glasdegib + LDAC was particularly prominent in patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

N2  - Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and mortality. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P <.001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax +/- anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels >=550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels >=40 mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04746092.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Mutations of the IGH variable region in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas cytogenetic complexity (>=3 unrelated aberrations) and translocations have been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. While mutational status of IGHV is stable, cytogenetic aberrations frequently evolve. However, the relationships of these features as prognosticators at diagnosis are unknown. We examined the CpG-stimulated metaphase cytogenetic features detected within 1 year of diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and correlated these features with outcome and other clinical features including IGHV mutational status. Of 329 untreated patients, 53 (16.1%) had a complex karyotype, and 85 (25.8%) had a translocation. The median time to first treatment (TFT) was 47 months. In univariable analyses, significant risk factors for shorter TFT (P<0.05) were Rai stage 3-4, b2-microglobulin >3.5 mg/L, log-transformed white blood cell count, unmutated IGHV, a complex karyotype, a translocation, and trisomy 8, del(11q) or del(17p) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In multivariable analysis, there was a significant effect modification of IGHV status on the relationship between translocation and TFT (P=0.002). In IGHV-mutated patients, those with a translocation had an over 3.5 times higher risk of starting treatment than those without a translocation (P<0.001); however, among IGHV-unmutated patients, a translocation did not significantly increase the risk of starting treatment (hazard ratio 1.00, P=0.99). The effect of Rai stage 3-4, log-transformed white blood cell count and complex karyotype remained statistically significant, whereas that of del(17p) did not (P=0.51). In summary, the presence of a translocation in IGHV-mutated patients appeared to negate the improved prognosis of mutated IGHV, but the presence of a translocation did not have an effect on TFT in high-risk IGHV-unmutated patients.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

N2  - Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the most frequent cause of post-transplantation mortality. Isolated extramedullary (EM) relapse (iEMR) after HSCT is relatively rare and not well characterized, particularly in pediatric patients. We retrospectively analyzed 1527 consecutive pediatric patients with acute leukemia after allo-HSCT to study the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of iEMR compared with systemic relapse. The 5-year cumulative incidence of systemic relapse (either bone marrow [BM] only or BM combined with EMR) was 24.8%, and that of iEMR was 5.5%. The onset of relapse after allo-HSCT was significantly longer in EM sites than in BM sites (7.19 and 5.58 months, respectively; P =.013). Complete response (CR) 2+/active disease at transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; P <.001) and prior EM disease (HR, 2.3; P =.007) were independent risk factors for iEMR. Chronic graft-versus-host disease reduced the risk of systemic relapse (HR, 0.5; P =.043) but did not protect against iEMR. The prognosis of patients who developed iEMR remained poor but was slightly better than that of patients who developed systemic relapse (3-year overall survival, 16.5% versus 15.3%; P =.089). Patients experiencing their first systemic relapse continued to have further systemic relapse, but only a minority progressed to iEMR, whereas those experiencing their iEMR at first relapse developed further systemic relapse and iEMR at approximately similar frequencies. A second iEMR was more common after a first iEMR than after a first systemic relapse (58.8% versus 13.0%; P =.001) and was associated with poor outcome. iEMR has a poor prognosis, particularly after a second relapse, and effective strategies are needed to improve outcomes.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

In the relapse group, overall survival (OS) was 38% (30-46%) at 2 years and 25% (17-32%) at 5 years. Patients who had a HLA-identical sibling (HLAid-Sib) donor for their first and second transplants had superior OS (5 year OS: HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 35% (24-46%); Others 9% (0-17%), p < 0.001). There was a significantly higher incidence of acute grade II-IV GvHD in those patients who had also developed GvHD following their initial HLA-identical sibling allo-HCT (HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 50% (33-67%); Other 22% (8-36%), p = 0.03). More as opposed to fewer than 2 years between transplants was associated with superior 5-yr OS (31% (21-40%) vs. 10% (1-20%), P = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants conferred a significant OS advantage (0.4 (0.24-0.67), p < 0.001). In the graft failure group, OS was 41% at 2 years. In summary, a second allo-HCT using a HLA-identical sibling donor, if available, provides the best transplant outcomes for relapsed myeloma in this setting.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Treatment benefit in multiple myeloma (MM) patients with high-risk cytogenetics remains suboptimal. The phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial (NCT02990338) showed that isatuximab plus pomalidomide-dexamethasone prolongs median progression-free survival (mPFS) in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). This subgroup analysis of ICARIA-MM compared the benefit of isatuximab in high-risk [defined by the presence of del(17p), t(4;14) or t(14;16)] versus standard-risk patients. The efficacy of isatuximab in patients with gain(1q21) abnormality was also assessed in a retrospective subgroup analysis. In ICARIA-MM, 307 patients received isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (n = 154) or pomalidomide-dexamethasone (n = 153). Isatuximab (10 mg/kg intravenously) was given weekly in the first 28-day cycle, and every other week thereafter. Standard pomalidomide-dexamethasone doses were given. Isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone improved mPFS (7.5 vs 3.7 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28) and overall response rate (ORR, 50.0% vs 16.7%) in high-risk patients. In patients with isolated gain(1q21), isatuximab addition improved mPFS (11.2 vs 4.6 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.88) and ORR (53.6% vs 27.6%). More grade >=3 adverse events occurred in high-risk patients receiving isatuximab (95.7%) versus the control group (67.6%); however, isatuximab did not increase events leading to discontinuation or treatment-related mortality. Isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone provides a consistent benefit over pomalidomide-dexamethasone treatment in RRMM patients regardless of cytogenetic risk.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 risk stratification by genetics is prognostic of outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is not well established. We examined the effect of 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on alloHCT outcomes of AML. We included 500 adult (>=18 years) AML patients in first (n = 370) or second (n = 130) complete remission receiving alloHCT from 2005 to 2016. Patients were classified into favorable (12%), intermediate (57%), and adverse (32%) 2017 ELN risk groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to conduct the multivariable analyses of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). Relapse and nonrelapse mortality were analyzed by the Fine-Gray regression model. OS at 2 years was 72% in the favorable versus 60% in the intermediate versus 45% in the adverse risk groups (P <.001). In multivariable analyses, the 2017 ELN classifier was an independent predictor of OS after alloHCT with significantly higher overall mortality in the intermediate (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.68; P =.03) and adverse (HR = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.54-4.06; P <.001) risk groups compared to the favorable risk group. Similarly, LFS was worse in the intermediate (HR = 1.63, 95%, CI 1.06-2.53; P =.03) and adverse (HR 2.23, 95% CI, 1.41-3.54; P <.001) risk groups while relapse was higher in the adverse risk group (HR = 2.36, 95% CI, 1.28-4.35; P =.006) as compared to the favorable risk group. These data highlight the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on the survival of AML patients after alloHCT. Patients in the adverse risk group had the highest risk of relapse and worst survival. Thus the 2017 ELN prognostic system can help identify AML patients who may benefit from clinical trials offering relapse mitigation strategies to improve transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Patients with core-binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), caused by either t(8; 21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), have higher complete remission rates and longer survival than patients with other subtypes of AML. However,;40% of patients relapse, and the literature suggests that patients with inv(16) fare differently from those with t(8;21). We retrospectively analyzed 537 patients with CBF-AML, focusing on additional cytogenetic aberrations to examine their impact on clinical outcomes. Trisomies of chromosomes 8, 21, or 22 were significantly more common in patients with inv(16)/t(16;16): 16% vs 7%, 6% vs 0%, and 17% vs 0%, respectively. In contrast, del(9q) and loss of a sex chromosome were more frequent in patients with t(8;21): 15% vs 0.4% for del(9q), 37% vs 0% for loss of X in females, and 44% vs 5% for loss of Y in males. Hyperdiploidy was more frequent in patients with inv(16) (25% vs 9%, whereas hypodiploidy was more frequent in patients with t(8;21) (37% vs 3%. In multivariable analyses (adjusted for age, white blood counts at diagnosis, and KIT mutation status), trisomy 8 was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in inv(16), whereas the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities (not trisomy 8) was associated with decreased OS. In patients with t(8;21), hypodiploidy was associated with improved disease-free survival; hyperdiploidy and del(9q) were associated with improved OS. KIT mutation (either positive or not tested, compared with negative) conferred poor prognoses in univariate analysis only in patients with t(8;21).Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Background: Adolescents and young adult (AYA) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) outcomes remain poor. The impact of locus of care (LOC; adult vs pediatric) in this population is unknown. Procedure: The IMPACT cohort comprises detailed data for all Ontario, Canada, AYA aged 15-21 years diagnosed with AML between 1992 and 2012, linked to population-based health administrative data. We determined the impact of LOC on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), treatment-related mortality (TRM), and relapse/progression. Result(s): Among 140 AYA, 51 (36.4%) received therapy at pediatric centers. The five-year EFS and OS for the whole cohort were 35.0% +/- 4.0% and 53.6% +/- 4.2%. Cumulative doses of anthracycline were higher among pediatric center AYA [median 355 mg/m2, interquartile range (IQR) 135-492 vs 202 mg/m2, IQR 140-364; P = 0.003]. In multivariable analyses, LOC was not predictive of either EFS [adult vs pediatric center hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-2.2, P = 0.27] or OS (HR 1.0, CI 0.6-1.6, P = 0.97). However, patterns of treatment failure varied; higher two-year incidence of TRM in pediatric centers (23.5% +/- 6.0% vs.10.1% +/- 3.2%; P = 0.046) was balanced by lower five-year incidence of relapse/progression (33.3% +/- 6.7% vs 56.2% +/- 5.3%; P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): AYA AML survival outcomes did not vary between pediatric and adult settings. Causes of treatment failure were different, with higher intensity pediatric protocols associated with higher TRM but lower relapse/progression. Careful risk stratification and enhanced supportive care may be of substantial benefit to AYA with AML by allocating maximal treatment intensity to patients who most benefit while minimizing the risk of TRM.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) has an annual incidence of 3-3.2 cases per million-person/year. National Cancer Data Base was used to identify newly diagnosed WM cases requiring initiation of therapy and their annual facility volume was used to divide the treatment facilities into four quartiles (Qs). Cox regression was used to analyze the association between facility volume and survival, adjusted by demographics, socioeconomic, geographic, comorbidity factors and year of diagnosis. A total of 3064 patients treated in 795 facilities were included. The unadjusted median overall survival (OS) by facility volume was: Q1:6.5 years (5-year OS 55%), Q2:7 years (5-year OS 60%), Q3:8 years (5-year OS 64%), and Q4: NR (5-year OS 71%), p < 0.0001. Our results demonstrated that a volume-outcome relationship exists in WM and is an independent predictor of overall survival in addition to the established risk factors as age and disease severity.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r Ph+ ALL) has an extremely poor prognosis. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has acquired unprecedented efficacy in B-cell malignancies, but its role in the long-term survival of r/r Ph+ ALL patients is unclear. We analyzed the effect of CART on 56 adults with r/r Ph+ ALL who accepted split doses of humanized CD19-targeted CART after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 51/56 (91.1%) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with inadequate count recovery (CRi), including 38 patients with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) tested by bone marrow BCR-ABL1 copies. Subsequently, 30/51 CR/CRi patients accepted consolidative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Their outcomes were compared with those of 21/51 contemporaneous patients without alloHSCT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of CR/CRi patients with alloHSCT were significantly superior to those without alloHSCT (58.9%, CI 49.8-68.0% vs. 22.7%, CI 12.7-32.7%, p = 0.005; 53.2%, CI 43.6-62.8% vs. 18.8%, CI 9.2-28.4%, p = 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that alloHSCT and MRD-negative post-CART were the independent prognostic factors for OS and LFS. CART therapy is highly effective for r/r Ph+ ALL patients, and consolidative alloHSCT could prolong their OS and LFS.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - We compared outcomes in 603 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after HLAhaploidentical relative (n5 176) and HLA-matched unrelated (n 5427) donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from 2012 to 2017, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database. All transplantations used reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Total-body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was the predominant regimen for HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was uniformly posttransplantation cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, and mycophenolate. Fludarabine with busulfan or melphalan was the predominant regimen for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT, and GVHD prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor with mycophenolate or methotrexate. Results of multivariate analysis revealed higher relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P 5 .0055; 2-year relapse rate, 48% vs 33%) and lower disease-free survival (DFS) rates after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT (HR, 1.29; P 5 .042; 2-year DFS, 29% vs 36%). However, overall survival (OS) rates did not differ between donor type (HR, 0.94; P 5 .65; 2-year OS, 46% for HLA-haploidentical and 44% for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT) because of mortality associated with chronic GVHD. Acute grade 2 to 4 GVHD (HR, 0.44; P , .0001) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.36; P , .0001) were lower after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT. By 2 years, probability of death resulting from chronic GVHD was lower after HLA-haploidentical relative compared with HLAmatched unrelated donor HCT (6% vs 21%), negating any potential survival advantage from better relapse control. Both donor types extend access to transplantation for patients with MDS; strategies for better relapse control are desirable for HLAhaploidentical relative donor HCT, and effective GVHD prophylaxis regimens are needed for unrelated donor HCT.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Pediatric regimens have improved outcomes in adolescent and young adult (AYA) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, results remain inferior to children with ALL. The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) ALL06 study (anzctr.org.au/ ACTRN12611000814976) was designed to assess whether a pediatric ALL regimen (Australian and New Zealand Children's Haematology and Oncology Group [ANZCHOG] Study 8) could be administered to patients aged 15 to 39 years in a comparable time frame to children as assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction/ consolidation and commencing the next phase of therapy (protocol M or high-risk [HR] treatment) by day 94. Minimal residual disease (MRD) response stratified patients to HR treatment and transplantation. From 2012 to 2018, a total of 86 patients were enrolled; 82 were eligible. Median age was 22 years (range, 16-38 years). Induction/consolidation was equally deliverable in ALL06 as in Study 8. In ALL06, 41.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7-52.9) commenced protocol M or HR therapy by day 94 vs 39.3% in Study 8 (P = .77). Median time to protocol M/HR treatment was 96 days (interquartile range, 87.5-103 days) in ALL06 vs 98 days in Study 8 (P = .80). Induction mortality was 3.6%. With a median follow-up of 44 months (1-96 months), estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 72.8% (95% CI, 62.8-82.7), and estimated 3-year overall survival was 74.9% (95% CI, 65.3-84.5). End induction/consolidation MRD negativity rate was 58.6%. Body mass index >=30 kg/m2 and day 79 MRD positivity were associated with poorer disease-free survival and overall survival. Pediatric therapy was safe and as deliverable in AYA patients as in children with ALL. Intolerance of pediatric ALL induction/consolidation is not a major contributor to inferior outcomes in AYA ALL.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Return to work (RTW) is a marker of functional recovery in cancer patients, with quality of life, financial and social implications. We investigated frequency and factors associated with RTW in a cohort of patients younger than 66 years, with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), uniformly treated with a bortezomib-based induction followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Socio-economic and working status data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. One hundred and eighty-six patients entered the study. Of whom, 145 (78%) where employed at diagnosis, which was more frequent in younger (median 55 vs. 60 years, p < 0.001), men (59.3% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.004), and with college studies (44.8% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.008). Forty-three (30%) of the 145 patients who had a job at diagnosis, RTW after ASCT in a median of 5 (range 1-27) months. Factors independently associated with RTW were having three or more children (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.33-6.18), college studies (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.21-6.41), and a family income >40 x 103/year (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.12-4.78). In conclusion, the frequency of RTW herein reported in MM patients seems lower than reported in other malignancies. The risk factors observed may guide the design RTW programs.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Truncation of asparaginase treatment due to asparaginase-related toxicities or silent inactivation (SI) is common and may increase relapse risk in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We investigated relapse risk following suboptimal asparaginase exposure among 1401 children aged 1 to 17 years, diagnosed with ALL between July 2008 and February 2016, treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol (including extended asparaginase exposure [1000 IU/m2 intramuscularly weeks 5-33]). Patients were included with delayed entry at their last administered asparaginase treatment, or detection of SI, and followed until relapse, death, secondary malignancy, or end of follow-up (median, 5.71 years; interquartile range, 4.02-7.64). In a multiple Cox model comparing patients with (n = 358) and without (n = 1043) truncated asparaginase treatment due to clinical toxicity, the adjusted relapse-specific hazard ratio (HR; aHR) was 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-2.06; P = .20). In a substudy including only patients with information on enzyme activity (n = 1115), the 7-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the 301 patients with truncation of asparaginase treatment or SI (157 hypersensitivity, 53 pancreatitis, 14 thrombosis, 31 other, 46 SI) was 11.1% (95% CI, 6.9-15.4) vs 6.7% (95% CI, 4.7-8.6) for the 814 remaining patients. The relapse-specific aHR was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.05-2.74, P=.03). The unadjusted bone marrow relapse-specific HR was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.07-3.14, P=.03) and 1.86 (95% CI, 0.90- 3.87, P=.095) for any central nervous system relapse. These results emphasize the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate adjustment of asparaginase therapy when feasible.

N2  - Posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has enabled haploidentical (Haplo) transplantation to be performed with results similar to those after matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation with traditional prophylaxis. The relative value of transplantation with MUD vs Haplo donors when both groups receive PTCy/calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis is not known. We compared outcomes after 2036 Haplo and 284 MUD transplantations with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in adults from 2011 through 2018. Cox regression models were built to compare outcomes between donor types. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens were analyzed separately. Among recipients of reduced-intensity regimens, 2-year graft failure (3% vs 11%), acute grades 2 to 4 GVHD (hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; P = .022), acute grades 3 and 4 GVHD (HR, 0.41; P = .016), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.43; P = .0008) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. Consequently, disease-free (HR, 0.74; P = .008; 55% vs 41%) and overall (HR, 0.65; P = .001; 67% vs 54%) survival were higher with MUD than with Haplo transplants. Among recipients of myeloablative regimens, day-100 platelet recovery (95% vs 88%) was higher and grades 3 and 4 acute (HR, 0.39; P = .07) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.66; P = .05) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. There were no differences in graft failure, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and disease-free and overall survival between donor types with myeloablative conditioning regimens. These data extend and confirm the importance of donor-recipient HLA matching for allogeneic transplantation. A MUD is the preferred donor, especially for transplantations with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Knowledge on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients from Argentina and Brazil is limited. Our series of 280 patients depicted an older age at diagnosis (median 72 years old), 26% of aberrant karyotypes, and a prevalence of myelodysplastic (60%) and CMML-0 subtypes (56%). The median overall survival (OS) was 48.2 months for patients in CMML-0 (Ref.), 24.7 months for those in CMML-1 (HR = 2.0, p = 0.001), and 8.8 months for patients in CMML-2 (HR = 4.6, p < 0.001). In the CMML-0 category, median OS were different between myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative subtypes (63.7 vs 21.2 months, p < 0.001); however, no differences were observed within CMML-1 and CMML-2 subtypes (24.7 vs 23.7 months, p = 0.540, and 9.1 vs 8.2 months, p = 0.160). The prognostic impact of 24 variables and 7 prognostic systems was adjusted to the WHO 2016 after validating their usefulness. Multivariate analysis were performed, and the final model revealed Hb >= 8 -< 10g/dL (HR 1.7), Hb < 8g/dL (HR 2.8), poor karyotypes (HR 2.1), WHO 2016-CMML-1 (HR 2.1), and CMML-2 (HR 3.5) as independent adverse clinical parameters in our cohort with a borderline influence of platelets count < 50 x 109/L (HR 1.4). We could validate several scoring systems, the WHO 2016 proposal and its prognostic capability, along with accessible covariates, on predicting the outcome in our series of CMML patients from Latin America.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The role of salvage high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (sHDCT/ASCT) for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in the era of continuous novel agent treatment has not been defined. This randomized, open-label, phase III, multicenter trial randomized patients with 1st-3rd relapse of multiple myeloma (MM) to a transplant arm (n = 139) consisting of 3 Rd (lenalidomide 25 mg, day 1-21; dexamethasone 40 mg, day 1, 8, 15, and 22; 4-week cycles) reinduction cycles, sHDCT (melphalan 200 mg/m2), ASCT, and lenalidomide maintenance (10 mg/day) or to a control arm (n = 138) of continuous Rd. Median PFS was 20.7 months in the transplant and 18.8 months in the control arm (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.65-1.16; p = 0.34). Median OS was not reached in the transplant and 62.7 months in the control arm (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.52-1.28; p = 0.37). Forty-one patients (29%) did not receive the assigned sHDCT/ASCT mainly due to early disease progression, adverse events, and withdrawal of consent. Multivariate landmark analyses from the time of sHDCT showed superior PFS and OS (p = 0.0087/0.0057) in patients who received sHDCT/ASCT. Incorporation of sHDCT/ASCT into relapse treatment with Rd was feasible in 71% of patients and did not significantly prolong PFS and OS on ITT analysis while patients who received sHDCT/ASCT may have benefitted.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have an increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs). Response-adapted treatment may decrease this risk by reducing exposure to therapy associated with SMN risk. The Children's Oncology Group study AHOD0031 evaluated response-adapted therapy for children and adolescents with intermediate-risk HL. We report the SMNs among 1711 patients enrolled in AHOD0031. Patients were treated with 4 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide with or without involved-field radiation therapy (RT). Patients with a slow early response to initial chemotherapy were randomized to 2 additional cycles of dexamethasone, etoposide, cisplatin and cytarabine or no additional chemotherapy, and all received RT. At a median follow-up of 7.3 years, an analysis of SMNs was performed. The 10-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.0). SMNs included 3 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 11 with solid tumors, and 3 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Sixteen of 17 patients with an SMN had received combined modality therapy. The standardized incidence ratio for SMN was 9.5 (95% CI, 4.5-15.2) with an excess absolute risk of 1.2 per 1000 person-years. The cumulative incidence of SMNs was higher among patients who received RT (P =.037). In multivariate analysis, RT, B symptoms, and race were associated with SMN risk. Given the latency from exposure, we have likely captured all cases of secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Longer follow-up is needed to determine the risk of solid tumors. Avoidance of RT without sacrificing disease control should remain a goal for future therapeutic approaches. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00025259., Key Points: * Among 1711 children with HL treated on the COG AHOD0031 trial, the 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancy is 1.32%. * The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary MDS/AML is 0.2%, which is similar to that observed with other HL therapies.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Therapeutic practices for multiple myeloma (MM) have evolved, such that novel-agent-based therapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (aPBSCT) is the current standard. Whether cause-specific mortality has changed with time remains unclear. We examined late cause-specific mortality among patients with MM receiving aPBSCT from 1989 to 2014. We conducted a prospective cohort study using participants enrolled in the enrolled in the Blood or Marrow Transplant Survivor Study. We created 3 eras to reflect changing MM therapy: <2000 (pre-thalidomide); 2000-2005 (thalidomide); 2006-2014 (lenalidomide). We used Kaplan-Meier techniques and Cox regression for examining all-cause mortality, and subdistribution hazards models for cause-specific mortality. In total, 1906 patients were followed up for a median of 9.2 years. Conditional on surviving 2 years, the 10-year overall survival was 45%. The 10-year cumulative incidence of myeloma- and non-myeloma-related mortality was 33% and 13%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed declining MM-specific mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]2000-2005 = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.07; SHR2006-2014 = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.34-0.62; referent group: <2000), infection-related mortality (SHR2000-2005 = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; SHR2006-2014 = 0.35, 95%CI 0.21-0.60; referent group: <2000) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality (SHR2000-2005 = 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.99; SHR2006-2014 = 0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.93; referent group: <2000). Although primary disease remains the major cause of late mortality, we observed a significant temporal decline in myeloma-, infection-, and cardiac-related late mortality over the past 25 years.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Despite therapeutic advances, early death (ED) remains a major factor curtailing survival of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Studies examining factors that cause early death (ED; within 30 days of admission) and the correlation of survival with the timing of administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and hemostatic parameters are scarce. We performed a cohort analysis of nonselect patients with newly diagnosed APL who presented to the health care system in Hong Kong, where oral arsenic trioxide was used. From 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2020, 358 patients (median age, 47 [1-97] years) with newly diagnosed APL were identified. ED occurred in 56 patients (16%): 11 (3%) died in the first 2 days after admission (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], n = 6; APLdifferentiation syndrome [APL-DS], n 5 4; infection, n = 1); 22 (6%) died within 3 to 7 days (ICH, n = 12; APL-DS, n = 8; infections, n = 2), and 23 (6%) died within 8 to 30 days (ICH, n = 7; APL-DS, n = 11; infection, n = 5). Factors significantly associated with ED by multivariate analysis included male sex (P = .01); presenting leukocyte count >=10 x 109/ L (P = .03); fibrinogen <1.5 g/L (P = .02); and ATRA administration >24 hours after hospital admission (P < .001). After a median follow-up of 47 (0-166) months, the 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 68.6% and 61.2%, respectively. Excluding EDs, the 5- and 10-year post-30-day OS improved to 81.3% and 72.5%. Early administration of ATRA (<24 hours) and vigorous correction of hemostatic abnormalities, including hypofibrinogenemia, are key to reducing ED.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

N2  - The presence of IKZF1 gene mutations is associated with poor prognosis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in this population. Ninety-five patients transplanted in first (n = 75) or second (n = 20) complete remission (CR) from either HLA-matched sibling (n = 32), unrelated (n = 47) or haploidentical (n = 16) donor were included in the analysis. The probabilities of the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 55% and 47%, respectively. Relapse incidence (RI) was 32% while non-relapse mortality (NRM), 21%. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD was 34% and 30%, respectively. The probability of GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 35%. In a multivariate analysis positive minimal residual disease (MRD) status was associated with decreased chance of LFS (HR = 3.15, p = 0.004) and OS (HR = 2.37, p = 0.049) as well as increased risk of relapse (HR = 5.87, p = 0.003). Disease stage (CR2 vs. CR1) affected all, LFS, OS, GRFS, RI, and NRM. Results of allo-HCT for patients with BCP-ALL and IKZF1 mutations are generally improving, however, individuals with detectable MRD have poor prognosis and require additional intervention prior to transplantation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The optimal conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has not been defined so far. In this retrospective study, we compared two "reduced-toxicity" regimens: intravenous busulfan at a total dose of 9.6 mg/kg (3 days) + fludarabine (Bu3/Flu) and total body irradiation at a dose of 8 Gy + fludarabine (TBI8Gy/Flu). In the entire study cohort (n = 518), the probabilities of overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years for Bu3/Flu and TBI8Gy/Flu were 62% vs. 72.5% (p = 0.051), 59.5% vs. 65% (p = 0.15), 30% vs. 20% (p = 0.01), and 10% vs. 14% (p = 0.18), respectively. In multivariate model for patients <50 years old, TBI8Gy/Flu was associated with improved LFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, p = 0.04), OS (HR = 0.31, p = 0.004), and survival free from both graft-versus-host disease and relapse (HR = 0.55, p = 0.03), as well as tendency to reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.53, p = 0.08). Among patients aged 50 years or older the use of TBI8Gy/Flu was associated with increased incidence of NRM (HR = 3.9, p = 0.0009), with no significant impact on other outcome measures. We conclude that the use of TBI8Gy/Flu as "reduced-toxicity" regimen may be advised in younger patients with AML referred for allo-HCT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Telomeres are involved in processes like cellular growth, chromosomal stability, and proper segregation to daughter cells. Telomere length measured in leukocytes (LTL) has been investigated in different cancer types, including multiple myeloma (MM). However, LTL measurement is prone to heterogeneity due to sample handling and study design (retrospective vs. prospective). LTL is genetically determined; genome-wide association studies identified 11 SNPs that, combined in a score, can be used as a genetic instrument to measure LTL and evaluate its association with MM risk. This approach has been already successfully attempted in various cancer types but never in MM. We tested the "teloscore" in 2407 MM patients and 1741 controls from the International Multiple Myeloma rESEarch (IMMeNSE) consortium. We observed an increased risk for longer genetically determined telomere length (gdTL) (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.36-2.11; P = 2.97 x 10-6 for highest vs. lowest quintile of the score). Furthermore, in a subset of 1376 MM patients we tested the relationship between the teloscore and MM patients survival, observing a better prognosis for longer gdTL compared with shorter gdTL (HR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.86-0.99; P = 0.049). In conclusion, we report convincing evidence that longer gdTL is a risk marker for MM risk, and that it is potentially involved in increasing MM survival.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Risk stratification is important for balancing potential risks and benefits of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological malignancies. We retrospectively studied 1119 patients undergoing allogenic-HSCT in a single center for five hematological indications assessing the prognostic role of LDH at admission for survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse incidence (RI), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), higher than median LDH had an adverse effect on survival. The prognostic significance was strongest in AML, with higher LDH levels having lower 1-and 3-year survival 69.2% vs. 50.8%, P < 0.001 and 51.9% vs. 39.2%, P < 0.001, respectively, reduced 1-and 3-year PFS 62.4% vs. 42.1%, P < 0.001 48% vs. 35.2%, P < 0.001, respectively, higher cumulative incidence of 1-and 3-year NRM 11% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.01 and 15.7% vs. 19.6%, P = 0.04, and higher 1-and 3-year relapse incidence (RI) 26.7% vs. 40.7%, p <.0001 36.2% vs. 40.7%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis LDH maintained significant prognostic capacity in OS, PFS and RI. These findings in AML, validated in an independent cohort, suggest that LDH is a readily available tool that could be integrated into transplant risk assessments to aid decision-making and identify high-risk patients who may benefit from post-transplant pharmacological or cellular strategies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - We retrospectively analyzed immunosuppression status in 287 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients and assessed the prognostic value of immunoparesis on survival. Deep immunoparesis was defined that one of uninvolved immunoglobulins was below 50% the lower limit of normal ranges, partial immunoparesis was defined at least two suppressed uninvolved immunoglobulins. We found that patients with deep and partial immunoparesis had a significantly shorter median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, deep and partial immunoparesis was a poor prognostic factor for OS and PFS in univariate and multivariable analyses. To reduce the bias between the groups, we performed a 1:1 propensity score matching technique for analysis and found that patients with deep and partial immunoparesis also had shorter OS and PFS. Our study showed that deep and partial immunoparesis can be defined an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with newly diagnosed MM.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Children of Hispanic/Latino ancestry have increased incidence of high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR B-ALL) with poor prognosis. This leukemia is characterized by a single-copy deletion of the IKZF1 (IKAROS) tumor suppressor and increased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This identifies mTOR as an attractive therapeutic target in HR B-ALL. Here, we report that IKAROS represses MTOR transcription and IKAROS' ability to repress MTOR in leukemia is impaired by oncogenic CK2 kinase. Treatment with the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, enhances IKAROS activity as a repressor of MTOR, resulting in reduced expression of MTOR in HR B-ALL. Thus, we designed a novel therapeutic approach that implements dual targeting of mTOR: direct inhibition of the mTOR protein (with rapamycin), in combination with IKAROS-mediated transcriptional repression of the MTOR gene (using the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945). Combination treatment with rapamycin and CX-4945 shows synergistic therapeutic effects in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts from Hispanic/Latino children with HR B-ALL. These data suggest that such therapy has the potential to reduce the health disparity in HR B-ALL among Hispanic/Latino children. The dual targeting of oncogene transcription, combined with inhibition of the corresponding oncoprotein provides a paradigm for a novel precision medicine approach for treating hematological malignancies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rare, and systematic data regarding outcome are scarce. This retrospective study summarized data from 11 consecutive Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed AML. In all, 3240 patients with AML were analyzed, and 36 (1.11%) were found to have CNS involvement at diagnosis. The incidence of CNS disease among the 5 studies with per protocol mandatory lumbar puncture (LP) was similar to the incidence among studies in which LP was performed at the discretion of the investigator (0.86% vs 1.41%; P 5 .18). There was no significant difference in the rate of complete remission (CR) among patients with CNS involvement and those with other extramedullary disease (EMD) sites or those with no EMD (52.8% vs 59.3%-60%). The median overall survival (OS) for patients who were CNS positive, who had other EMD, or who had no EMD was 11.4, 11.3, and 12.7 months, respectively. There was no difference in OS among patients with CNS involvement, those with other EMD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; adjusted P 5 .84), and those with no EMD (HR, 1.19; adjusted P 5 .44). In conclusion, the reported incidence of CNS involvement in patients with newly diagnosed AML is low (1.1%), irrespective of whether an LP is mandatory or not. The presence of CNS disease at diagnosis in and of itself does not seem to portend a poor prognosis for achieving an initial CR or for OS.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Despite the substantial clinical activity of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors in relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3-ITD-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), durable remissions and prolonged survival in this population require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Quizartinib, a once-daily oral, highly potent, and selective FLT3 inhibitor, significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and improved clinical benefit compared with salvage chemotherapy (median OS, 6.2 months versus 4.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], .58 to .98; P = .018; composite complete remission [CRc] rate, 48% versus 27%; median duration of CRc, 2.8 months versus 1.2 months; mortality rate, .8% versus 14% by day 30, 7% versus 24% by day 60) in patients with R/R FLT3-ITD AML in the phase 3 QuANTUM-R trial. In this post hoc analysis, we described the characteristics of and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent on-study HSCT in QuANTUM-R at the investigator's discretion and institutional practices. Of 367 randomized patients, 78 (32%) in the quizartinib arm and 14 (11%) in the salvage chemotherapy arm underwent on-study allo-HSCT without any intervening therapy for AML after quizartinib or study-specified salvage chemotherapy. Pooled data of patients from both treatment arms showed a longer median overall survival (OS) in transplant recipients versus those treated without allo-HSCT (12.2 months versus 4.4 months; HR, .315; 95% CI, .233 to .427). Pooled data also showed a longer median OS in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT versus patients without a CRc (20.1 months versus 8.8 months; HR, .506; 95% CI, .296 to .864). By treatment arm, the median OS was 25.1 months with quizartinib and 20.1 months with salvage chemotherapy in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT. Forty-eight patients in the quizartinib arm continued quizartinib treatment after allo-HSCT. In the 31 patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT who continued quizartinib after allo-HSCT, the median OS was 27.1 months. Continuation of quizartinib after allo-HSCT was tolerable, and no new safety signals were identified. These results suggest that post-transplantation survival following salvage chemotherapy and quizartinib treatment are similar. However, quizartinib response occurs more frequently than with salvage chemotherapy, potentially allowing more patients to undergo transplantation and achieve durable clinical benefit. In addition, post-transplant quizartinib was found to be tolerable and may be associated with prolonged survival in some patients, highlighting its potential value in the management of patients with FLT3-ITD R/R AML.

N2  - The inclusion of mutation status improved risk stratification for newly diagnosed patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment option, and patient selection is critical because of relevant transplant-related morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the impact of mutation status together with clinical presentations on posttransplant outcome. Our study included 240 patients with a median follow-up of 5.5 years. A significant association with worse survival was identified for the presence of mutations in ASXL1 and/or NRAS. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), marrow blasts.2% (HR, 1.70), and increasing comorbidity index (continuous HR, 1.16) were independently associated with worse survival. A prognostic score (CMML transplant score) was developed, and the following points were assigned: 4 points for an ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype or blasts.2% and 1 point each for an increase of 1 in the comorbidity index. The CMML transplant score (range, 0-20) was predictive of survival and nonrelapse mortality (P,.001 for both). Up to 5 risk groups were identified, showing 5-year survival of 81% for a score of 0 to 1, 49% for a score of 2 to 4, 43% for a score of 5 to 7, 31% for a score of 8 to 10, and 19% for a score.10. The score retained performance after validation (concordance index, 0.68) and good accuracy after calibration. Predictions were superior compared with existing scores designed for the nontransplant setting, which resulted in significant risk reclassification. This CMML transplant score, which incorporated mutation and clinical information, was prognostic in patients specifically undergoing transplantation and may facilitate personalized counseling.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology

N2  - We analyzed newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with del(17p) and/or t(4;14) undergoing either upfront single autologous (auto), tandem autologous (auto-auto) or tandem autologous/reduced-intensity allogeneic (auto-allo) stem cell transplantation. 623 patients underwent either auto (n = 446), auto-auto (n = 105), or auto-allo (n = 72) between 2000 and 2015. 46% of patients had t(4;14), 45% had del(17p) while 9% were reported having both abnormalities. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45-58%) for single auto, 60% (95% CI, 49-72%) for auto-auto, and 67% (95% CI, 53-80%) for auto-allo (p = 0.187). Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 17% (95% CI, 12-22%), 33% (95% CI, 22-43%), and 34% (95% CI, 21-38%; p = 0.048). Five-year relapse rate was 82, 63, and 56%, while non-relapse mortality was 1, 4, and 10%. In multivariable analysis, in t(4;14) with single auto as reference, auto-auto (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; p = 0.007) and auto-allo (HR, 0.45; p = 0.018) were associated with better PFS. In terms of t(4;14) and OS, auto-auto appeared to improve outcome compared with single auto (HR, 0.49; p = 0.096). In del(17p), outcome in PFS was similar between single auto and auto-auto, while auto-allo appeared to improve PFS (HR, 0.65; p = 0.097). No significant difference in OS was identified between the groups in patients with del(17p).Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The critical question in the management of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is which patients may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Using ad hoc statistical analysis, we designed a multicenter retrospective study to determine outcomes in 261 patients age <=70 years at diagnosis who underwent allo-HCT (n = 119) compared with those who did not (n = 142) according to the current CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS). Categorizing patients as lower risk (CPSS low/intermediate-1) or higher risk (intermediate-2/high) showed significantly improved outcomes after transplantation in higher-risk patients, with a 37% reduced hazard for death. However, although higher CPSS was associated with worse outcomes in the nontransplantation group, the score was of limited utility for post-transplantation risk stratification. This study may provide further support for the potentially beneficial role of allo-HCT in terms of long-term survival in higher-risk patients but also underscores the need for transplantation-specific risk assessment. Recognizing limitations of retrospective comparisons, larger and prospective comparisons are needed to further refine the indication for allo-HCT and thus counseling of patients with CMML.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is recommended for adults acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative during their first complete remission (CR1). However, the role of pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy remains unclear. We evaluated 78 CR1/MRD-negative patients, the consolidation and non-consolidation groups had similar 5-year OS (74.8% [95% CI: 62.2-87.3%] vs. 74.2% [95% CI: 53.2-95.1%], p =.894), RFS (72.2% [95% CI: 59.6-84.7%] vs. 73.1% [95% CI: 54.2-91.9%], p =.942), CIR (9.4% [95% CI: 9.1-9.7%] vs. 18.9% [95% CI: 17.3-20.4%], p =.376), and NRM (18.4% [95% CI: 17.7-19.0%] vs. 8.0% [95% CI: 7.3-8.6%], p =.375). Multivariable analysis confirmed that high cytogenetic risk independently predicted poor OS and RFS, although pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy did not predict the prognosis. Based on these findings, we recommend performing transplantation immediately for adult ALL patients after they have achieved CR1/MRD-negative status when there are readily available donors.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Introduction: Randomized clinical trials showed that bortezomib, in addition to conventional chemotherapy, improves survival and disease progression in multiple myeloma (MM) patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation. The aim of this retrospective population-based cohort study is the evaluation of both clinical and economic profile of bortezomib-based versus conventional chemotherapy in daily clinical practice. Method(s): Healthcare utilization databases of six Italian regions were used to identify adult patients with non-transplant MM, who started a first-line therapy with bortezomib-based or conventional chemotherapy. Patients were matched by propensity score and were followed from treatment start until death, lost to follow-up or study end-point. Overall survival (OS) and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Association between first-line treatment and risk of death was estimated by a conditional Cox proportional regression model. Average mean cumulative costs were estimated and compared between groups. Result(s): In the period 2010-2016, 3509 non-transplant MM patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 1157 treated with bortezomib-based therapy were matched to 1826 treated with conventional chemotherapy. Median OS and RMST were 33.9 and 27.9 months, and 42.9 and 38.4 months, respectively, in the two treatment arms. Overall, these values corresponded to a HR of death of 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.89) over a time horizon of 84 months. Average cumulative cost were 83,839  and 54,499 , respectively, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 54,333  per year of life gained, a cost coherent with the willingness-to-pay thresholds frequently adopted from Western countries. Conclusion(s): These data suggested that, in a large cohort of non-transplant MM patients treated outside the experimental setting, first-line treatment with bortezomib-based therapy was associated with a favourable effectiveness and cost-effectiveness profile.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

N2  - The standard of care for patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) relapsing after front-line treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO)-based regimens remains to be defined. A total of 67 patients who relapsed after receiving ATO-based up-front therapy and were also salvaged using an ATO-based regimen were evaluated. The median (range) age of patients was 28 (4-54) years. While 63/67 (94%) achieved a second molecular remission (MR) after salvage therapy, three (4.5%) died during salvage therapy. An autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) was offered to all patients who achieved MR, 35/63 (55.6%) opted for auto-SCT the rest were administered an ATO + all-trans retinoic acid maintenance regimen. The mean (SD) 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival and event-free survival of those who received auto-SCT versus those who did not was 90.3 (5.3)% versus 58.6 (10.4)% (P = 0.004), and 87.1 (6.0)% versus 47.7 (10.3)% (P = 0.001) respectively. On multivariate analysis, failure to consolidate MR with an auto-SCT was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse [hazard ratio (HR) 4.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56-15.41; P = 0.006]. MR induction with ATO-based regimens followed by an auto-SCT in children and young adults with relapsed APL who were treated with front-line ATO-based regimens was associated with excellent long-term survival.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by painful lesions that are amenable to palliative radiotherapy (PRT) but racial disparities may exist. In the current study, the National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with MM from 2004 to 2016 who received PRT. The percentages of patients receiving PRT within 12 months of diagnosis by race/ethnicity were: 15.5% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 14.3% African American (AA), 15.8% Hispanic, and 14.4% other. On multivariable logistic regression, the odds of receiving RT were 13% less for AAs compared to NHWs (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83-0.90, p <.0001) and the odds of dying within 30 days of PRT were 18% less for AAs compared to NHWs (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.67-1.00, p =.046). This study highlights a health disparity affecting AA patients who despite having a higher incidence and mortality from MM are also less likely to receive PRT within 1 year of diagnosis and near the end of life.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a membrane receptor that mediates the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Uptake of LDL has been proposed to contribute to chemotherapy resistance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines in vitro. In the present study, we analysed LDLR expression and survival using bone marrow biopsies from 187 intensively treated patients with AML. Here, increasing LDLR expression was associated with decreasing overall (58.4%, 44.2%, and 24.4%; P = 0.0018), as well as event-free survival (41.7%, 18.1%, and 14.3%; P = 0.0077), and an increasing cumulative incidence of relapse (33.9%, 55.1%, and 71.4%; P = 0.0011). Associations of LDLR expression with survival were confirmed in 557 intensively treated patients from two international validation cohorts. In the analytic and validation cohorts, LDLR expression remained associated with outcome in multivariable regression analyses including the European LeukemiaNet genetic risk classification. Thus, LDLR predicts outcome of patients with AML beyond existing risk factors. Furthermore, we found low expression levels of LDLR in most healthy tissues, suggesting it as a promising target for antibody-based pharmacodelivery approaches in AML.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - The purpose of our study is to highlight the demographic characteristics, pathological features, and clinical course of multiple myeloma (MM) patients with secondary primary malignancies (SPM). A retrospective chart review was performed from January 2009 to February 2020. Patients' demographic, pathologic and cytogenetic features, treatment characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. We identified 871 MM patients including 40 patients who developed SPM. Among the 40 patients with SPM, 17 patients developed hematological SPM and 23 patients developed solid SPM. The median time from diagnosis of MM to the occurrence of hematological SPM was 6.85 versus 3.91 years in solid SPM, with a median overall survival (OS) after diagnosis of SPM of 120 and 880 days, respectively. Interestingly, we observed that there was no significant difference in OS between MM patients with or without SPM. Multivariable analysis showed that age and autologous stem cell transplantation were independent factors associated with patients' clinical outcomes. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the etiology, biology, clinical outcome and management in MM patients with SPM.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - In this large single-centre study, we report high prevalence (25%) of, small (<10%) and very small (<1%), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clones by high-sensitive cytometry among 3085 patients tested. Given PNH association with bone marrow failures, we analyzed 869 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 531 aplastic anemia (AA) within the cohort. PNH clones were more frequent and larger in AA vs. MDS (p = 0.04). PNH clone, irrespective of size, was a good predictor of response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and to stem cell transplant (HSCT) (in MDS: 84% if PNH+ vs. 44.7% if PNH-, p = 0.01 for IST, and 71% if PNH+ vs. 56.6% if PNH- for HSCT; in AA: 78 vs. 50% for IST, p < 0.0001, and 97 vs. 77%, p = 0.01 for HSCT). PNH positivity had a favorable impact on disease progression (0.6% vs. 4.9% IPSS-progression in MDS, p < 0.005; and 2.1 vs. 6.9% progression to MDS in AA, p = 0.01), leukemic evolution (6.8 vs. 12.7%, p = 0.01 in MDS), and overall survival [73% (95% CI 68-77) vs. 51% (48-54), p < 0.0001], with a relative HR for mortality of 2.37 (95% CI 1.8-3.1; p < 0.0001) in PNH negative cases, both in univariate and multivariable analysis. Our data suggest systematic PNH testing in AA/MDS, as it might allow better prediction/prognostication and consequent clinical/laboratory follow-up timing.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Continuous lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd)-based regimens are among the standards of care in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. The oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib is suitable for continuous dosing, with predictable, manageable toxicities. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM2 trial, transplant-ineligible NDMM patients were randomized to ixazomib 4 mg (n = 351) or placebo (n = 354) plus Rd. After 18 cycles, dexamethasone was discontinued and treatment was continued using reduced-dose ixazomib (3 mg) and lenalidomide (10 mg) until progression/toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 35.3 vs 21.8 months with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.830; 95% confidence interval, 0.676-1.018; P = .073; median follow-up, 53.3 and 55.8 months). Complete (26% vs 14%; odds ratio [OR], 2.10; P < .001) and >= very good partial response (63% vs 48%; OR, 1.87; P < .001) rates were higher with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd. In a prespecified high-risk cytogenetics subgroup, median PFS was 23.8 vs 18.0 months (HR, 0.690; P = .019). Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly grade 1/2. With ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, 88% vs 81% of patients experienced grade >=3 TEAEs, 66% vs 62% serious TEAEs, and 35% vs 27% TEAEs resulting in regimen discontinuation; 8% vs 6% died on study. Addition of ixazomib to Rd was tolerable with no new safety signals and led to a clinically meaningful PFS benefit of 13.5 months. Ixazomib-Rd is a feasible option for certain patients who can benefit from an all-oral triplet combination. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01850524.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with t(4;11)(q21;q23);KMT2A/AFF1 is a poor-prognosis entity. This registry-based study was aimed to analyze outcome of patients with t(4;11) BCP-ALL treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) between 2000 and 2017, focusing on the impact of measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of transplant. Among 151 patients (median age, 38) allotransplanted from either HLA-matched siblings or unrelated donors, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 51% and 60%, whereas relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 30% and 20%, respectively. These results were comparable to a cohort of contemporary patients with diploid normal karyotype (NK) BCP-ALL with equivalent inclusion criteria (n = 567). Among patients with evaluable MRD pre-alloHSCT, a negative status was the strongest beneficial factor influencing LFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.2, p < 0.001), OS (HR = 0.14, p < 0.001), RI (HR = 0.23, p = 0.001), and NRM (HR = 0.16, p = 0.002), with a similar outcome to MRD-negative NK BCP-ALL patients. In contrast, among patients with detectable pretransplant MRD, outcome in t(4;11) BCP-ALL was inferior to NK BCP-ALL (LFS: 27% vs. 50%, p = 0.02). These results support indication of alloHSCT in CR1 for t(4;11) BCP-ALL patients, provided a negative MRD status is achieved. Conversely, pre-alloHSCT additional therapy is warranted in MRD-positive patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - One hundred and sixty-one patients underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) with thiotepa, busulfan, and fludarabine conditioning followed by post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) (on days +3 and +4) and tacrolimus as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Forty-two percent of patients had a high or very high revised Disease Risk Index (rDRI), 55% had an European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score (EBMT-RS) >=4, and 36% had an age-adjusted Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI-age) score >=3. Each of these was considered an unfavorable score. Using the pretransplantation unfavorable scores that had an independent impact on each transplantation outcome studied in multivariate analysis allowed for better stratification of patient outcomes. Thus, the 3-year overall survival (OS) in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 unfavorable scores was 86%, 56%, 36%, and 24%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was negatively impacted by the EBMT-RS and the HCT-CI-age score (3-year NRM in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores was 12%, 33%, and 43%, respectively), whereas the EBMT-RS and the rDRI had an impact on the 3-year relapse incidence (8%, 18%, and 41% in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores, respectively). In conclusion, our study shows that combining 2 or 3 of these well-defined pretransplantation scores improves the ability to predict transplantation outcomes in the setting of haploSCT with PTCy.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

T1  - Defining low-risk high hyperdiploidy in patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a retrospective analysis of data from the UKALL97/99 and UKALL2003 clinical trials

N2  - Background: High hyperdiploidy is the most common genetic subtype of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and is associated with a good outcome. However, some patients relapse and, given its prevalence, patients with high hyperdiploidy account for a large proportion of all relapses. We aimed to evaluate putative risk factors and determine the optimal pattern of trisomies for predicting outcome. Method(s): We used discovery and validation cohorts from consecutive trials-UKALL97/99 (n=456) and UKALL2003 (n=725)-to develop the prognostic profile. UKALL97/99 recruited patients aged 1-18 years between Jan 1, 1997, and June 15, 2002, and UKALL2003 recruited children and young adults aged 1-24 years between Oct 1, 2003, and June 30, 2001, from the UK and Ireland who were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation testing was performed on pre-treatment bone marrow samples by regional UK National Health Service genetic laboratories or centrally by the Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, and results were reported using established nomenclature and definitions. We examined the prognostic effect of previously proposed genetic and non-genetic risk factors among patients with high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on UKALL2003. We used Bayesian information criterion, targeted projection pursuit, and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal number of trisomies, and best subset regression and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal combination. Survival analysis considered three endpoints, as follows: event-free survival, defined as time to relapse, second tumour, or death, censored at last contact; relapse rate, defined as time to relapse for those reaching complete remission, censored at death in remission or last contact; and overall survival, defined as time to death, censored at last contact. Finding(s): The median follow-up time for UKALL97/99 was 10.59 years (IQR 9.25-12.06) and 9.40 years (8.00-11.55) for UKALL2003. UKALL97/99 included 208 female patients and 248 male patients, and UKALL2003 included 345 female patients and 380 male patients. We deduced that the trisomic status of four chromosomes provided the optimal information for predicting outcome. The good risk profile comprised karyotypes with +17 and +18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20. All remaining cases were classified in the poor risk profile. The ratio of patients with good risk and poor risk was 82:18 and 80:20 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, patients with the high hyperdiploid good risk profile had an improved response to treatment compared with other patients with high hyperdiploidy at 10 years (relapse rate 5% [95% CI 3-7] vs 16% [10-23]; p<0.0001; event-free survival 92% [90-94] vs 81% [73-86]; p<0.0001; and overall survival 96% [94-97] vs 86% [79-91]; p<0.0001). The outcome for high hyperdiploid poor risk patients was similar to that of patients with an intermediate cytogenetic profile. The prognostic effect of the UKALL high hyperdiploid profile was independent of minimal residual disease and the profile outperformed other high hyperdiploid risk profiles. Interpretation(s): Future clinical trials and treatment protocols using high hyperdiploidy as a risk stratification factor should consider modifying the definition beyond chromosome count to incorporate this novel UKALL high hyperdiploid profile.

N2  - Variation in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Because antibiotics induce dysbiosis, we examined the association of broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent aGVHD risk in pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia. We performed a retrospective analysis in a dataset merged from 2 sources: (1) the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, an observational transplantation registry, and (2) the Pediatric Health Information Services, an administrative database from freestanding children's hospitals. We captured exposure to 3 classes of antibiotics used for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia: (1) broad-spectrum cephalosporins, (2) antipseudomonal penicillins, and (3) carbapenems. The primary outcome was grade II-IV aGVHD; secondary outcomes were grade III-IV aGVHD and lower GI GVHD. The adjusted logistic regression model (full cohort) and time-to-event analysis (subcohort) included transplantation characteristics, GVHD risk factors, and adjunctive antibiotic exposures as covariates. The full cohort included 2550 patients at 36 centers; the subcohort included 1174 patients. In adjusted models, carbapenems were associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD in the full cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.51) and subcohort (sub hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.72), as well as with an increased risk of grade III-IV aGVHD (subHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.52). Early carbapenem exposure (before day 0) especially impacted aGVHD risk. For antipseudomonal penicillins, the associations with aGVHD were in the direction of increased risk but were not statistically significant. There was no identified association between broad-spectrum cephalosporins and aGVHD. Carbapenems, more than other broad-spectrum antibiotics, should be used judiciously in pediatric HCT recipients to minimize aGVHD risk. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying this association.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Background: Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is one of the many side effects encountered during acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. Due to the rarity of cases, lack of data, and consensus management, no recommendations exist to target the population at risk. Method(s): This is a retrospective chart review of 229 consecutive patients diagnosed with ALL with an age range of 1-21 years, treated at the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon between October 2007 and February 2018. Result(s): The incidence of CSVT was 10.5%. Using univariate analysis, increased risk of CSVT was observed with male gender, age >10 years, T-cell immunophenotype, intermediate/high-risk disease, maximum triglyceride (TG) level of >615 mg/dl, presence of mediastinal mass, and larger body surface area (BSA). With multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant risk factors were maximum TG level, BSA, presence of mediastinal mass, and risk stratification (intermediate/high risk). Conclusion(s): Our study was able to unveil TG level of >615 mg/dl, mediastinal mass, and a larger BSA as novel risk factors that have not been previously discussed in the literature.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Background: Children with hematologic malignancies, especially those who receive intensive chemotherapy, are at high risk for invasive mold infections (IMI) that confer substantial mortality. Randomized controlled trials support the use of antifungal prophylaxis with antimold activity as an optimal strategy for risk reduction in this population, but studies outlining the practical application of evidence-based recommendations are lacking. Procedure: We conducted a 15-year, single-institution retrospective review in a diverse cohort of children with hematologic malignancies treated with chemotherapy to determine the incidence of proven or probable IMI diagnosed between 2006 and 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify host and disease factors associated with IMI risk. We then compared the incidence and type of IMI and related factors before and after 2016 implementation of an evidence-based, risk-adapted antifungal prophylaxis algorithm that broadened coverage to include molds in patients at highest risk for IMI. Result(s): We identified 61 cases of proven or probable IMI in 1456 patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies during the study period (4.2%). Implementation of an antifungal prophylaxis algorithm reduced the IMI incidence in this population from 4.8% to 2.9%. Both Hispanic ethnicity and cancer diagnosis prior to 2016 were associated with risk for IMI. Conclusion(s): An evidence-based, risk-adapted approach to antifungal prophylaxis for children with hematologic malignancies is an effective strategy to reduce incidence of IMI.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Background: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) administered before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) has been linked to an increased risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS). Procedure: This retrospective analysis examined VOD/SOS risk and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received myeloablative alloHCT in 2008-2011 with (n = 148) and without (n = 348; controls) prior GO exposure and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Result(s): Cumulative incidences (95% confidence interval [CI]) of VOD/SOS and severe VOD/SOS, respectively, at 100 days were 16% (11-23%) and 8% (4-13%) for GO-exposed patients and 10% (7-13%) and 3% (2-5%) for controls. With a median follow-up of approximately 7 years, the 5-year adjusted overall survival probability (95% CI) after alloHCT was 51% (43-58%) and 55% (50-60%) for GO-exposed patients and controls, respectively; three (4%) and one (<1%) deaths were attributed to VOD/SOS. In multivariate analyses, GO exposure was observed to be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS at 100 days, but was not associated with overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, or nonrelapse mortality. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that GO treatment prior to alloHCT in pediatric patients may increase the risk of VOD/SOS but not death.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Prolonged Covid-19 is an emerging issue for patients with lymphoma or immune deficiency. We aimed to examine prolonged length of in-hospital stay (LOS) due to Covid-19 among patients with lymphoma and assess its determinants and outcomes. Adult patients with lymphoma admitted for Covid-19 to 16 French hospitals in March and April, 2020 were included. Length of in-hospital stay was analyzed as a competitor vs death. The study included 111 patients. The median age was 65 years (range, 19-92). Ninety-four patients (85%) had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti-CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1-235). After a median follow-up of 191 days (3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42-3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.52, p = 0.039). An age >= 70 years and relapsed/refractory lymphoma were also associated with prolonged LOS and decreased overall survival. In conclusion, an age >= 70 years, a relapsed/refractory lymphoma and recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy are risk factors for prolonged LOS and death for lymphoma patients hospitalized for Covid-19. These findings may contribute to guide the management of lymphoma during the pandemic, support evaluating specific therapeutic approaches, and raise questions on the efficacy and timing of vaccination of this particular population.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated by intensive chemotherapy (IC), prognostic significance of co-occurring genetic alterations and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are of particular interest with the advent of IDH1/2 mutant inhibitors. We retrospectively analyzed 319 patients with newly diagnosed AML (127 with IDH1, 135 with IDH2R140, and 57 with IDH2R172 mutations) treated with IC in 3 Acute Leukemia French Association prospective trials. In each IDH subgroup, we analyzed the prognostic impact of clinical and genetic covariates, and the role of HSCT. In patients with IDH1 mutations, the presence of NPM1 mutations was the only variable predicting improved overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (P < .0001). In IDH2R140-mutated AML, normal karyotype (P = .008) and NPM1 mutations (P = .01) predicted better OS. NPM1 mutations were associated with better disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0009), whereas the presence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with shorter DFS (P = .0006). In IDH2R172-mutated AML, platelet count was the only variable retained in the multivariate model for OS (P = .002). Among nonfavorable European LeukemiaNet 2010-eligible patients, 71 (36%) underwent HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) and had longer OS (P = .03) and DFS (P = .02) than nontransplanted patients. Future clinical trials testing frontline IDH inhibitors combined with IC may consider stratification on NPM1 mutational status, the primary prognostic factor in IDH1- or IDH2R140-mutated AML. HSCT improve OS of nonfavorable IDH1/2-mutated AML and should be fully integrated into the treatment strategy.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML), including cases with KIT mutation, is currently defined as a low-risk AML. However, some patients have poor response to treatment, and the prognostic significance of KIT mutation is still controversial. This study aimed to explore the prognostic significance of different KIT mutation subtypes and minimal residual disease (MRD) in CBF-AML. We retrospectively evaluated continuous patients diagnosed with CBF-AML in our center between January 2014 and April 2019. Of the 215 patients, 147 (68.4%) and 68 (31.6%) patients were RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and CBFB-MYH11 positive, respectively. KIT mutations were found in 71 (33.0%) patients; of them, 38 (53.5%) had D816/D820 mutations. After excluding 10 patients who died or were lost to follow-up within a half year, 42.0% (n = 86) of the remaining 205 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). An MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation predicted relapse (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that D816 or D820 mutations and MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation were independent adverse factors affecting relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Allo-HSCT could improve RFS (74.4% vs. 34.6%, P < 0.001) and OS (78.1% vs. 52.3%, P = 0.002). In conclusion, high-risk CBF-AML patients must be identified before treatment. D816/D820 mutation, MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy predicted poor survivals, and allo-HSCT can improve the survival of properly identified patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Identifying a suitable volunteer unrelated donor (UD) in South Africa is challenging due to the highly diverse ethnic groups and mixed-race populations in this region. Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) is thus an attractive procedure for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. This study was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of haploHCT in South Africa. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who received unmanipulated haploHCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide at 2 high-volume HCT centers between 2014 and 2019. We assessed overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), and incidence of acute GVHD. The median recipient age was 44 years (range, 15 to 73 years) and the median donor age was 36 years (range, 9 to 68 years). Acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the most common indications for haploHCT (61.2%). The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score was >=5 in 44 patients (32.8%). Seventy-seven patients (57.4%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The majority of patients received a sex-matched transplant (57.4%) and had peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) as the stem cell source (70.9%). Sixteen patients (11.9%) had an incongruent cytomegalovirus serostatus at transplantation. The median duration of follow-up was 10.8 months (range, 0.36 to 70.8 months). OS was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47% to 64%) at 1 year and 37% (95% CI, 28% to 47%) at 3 years. DFS was 47% (95% CI, 38% to 55%) at 1 year and 32% (95% CI, 24% to 41%) at 3 years. The 100-day and 3-year cumulative incidence of NRM was 18% (95% CI, 11% to 25%) and 41% (95% CI, 32% to 50%), respectively, and the 1- and 3-year cumulative RI was 16% (95% CI, 11% to 24%) and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%), respectively. The 1-year OS was 55% (95% CI, 40% to 67%) for the patients with AML/MDS versus 41% (95% CI, 21% to 60%) for those with ALL. Forty-five patients (41.7%) developed acute GVHD by day +100; of these, 80% had grade I-II disease. Fifty patients (37.5%) developed cytomegalovirus infection that required therapy. On multivariable analysis, older donor age was an independent risk factor for lower DFS. RI was higher for diagnoses other than acute leukemia/MDS (relative risk [RR], 2.62; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.15; P = .027), decreased for PBSC versus bone marrow (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.95; P = .038) and decreased for offspring donors (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.67; P = .006). These data support the feasibility of haploHCT and suggest that unmanipulated haploHCT using a younger parent or offspring donor is a viable option for adults in sub-Saharan Africa with acute leukemia and MDS who lack a suitable related or unrelated donor.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Older age and poor performance status lead to worse outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Hypoalbuminemia is a negative predictor of morbidity and mortality in several malignancies. We evaluated the relationship between baseline serum albumin levels on treatment-related complications, as well as short-term mortality and overall survival (OS) in 756 newly diagnosed AML patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to examine treatment-related complications and OS according to pretreatment serum albumin levels: normal albumin >=3.5 g/dl, marked hypoalbuminemia <2.5 g/dl, and hypoalbuminemia 2.5-3.4 g/dl. In an adjusted multivariate analysis, a lower baseline albumin was independently associated with a higher number of grade >=3 complications when adjusting for age, secondary AML, sex and intensive treatment. When comparing normal to markedly low albumin levels, the estimated mean number of complications increases by a factor of 1.35. Patients who had a normal baseline albumin had a 30 day-mortality rate of 4.8%, which was significantly lower compared with patients with hypoalbuminemia (16.5%) and marked hypoalbuminemia (33.9%; p < 0.01). Similarly, 60-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the hypoalbuminemia group (24.0%) and marked hypoalbuminemia group (45%) compared with normal albumin group (8.3%; p < 0.01). Patients with lower baseline albumin levels have increased treatment-related morbidity and mortality, suggesting that pre-treatment serum albumin is an important independent prognostic marker.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - To explore the differences in the clinical features, treatment responses, and outcomes among children, adolescents, and adults with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving imatinib as first-line therapy. Data from children (0-8 years for girls and 0-10 years for boys), adolescents (9-19 years for girls and 11-19 years for boys), and adults (age >= 20 years) with newly diagnosed CML-CP receiving imatinib as first-line therapy between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 135 children (cohort 1), 189 adolescents (cohort 2), and 658 adults (cohort 3: age 20-39 years, n = 305; cohort 4: age 40-59 years, n = 270; and cohort 5: age 60-83 years, n = 83) were included in this study. When compared with children, adolescents showed a significantly higher white blood cell count (P = 0.033) and basophil percentage in peripheral blood (P = 0.002) and a significantly higher prevalence of splenomegaly (P = 0.004). Both children and adolescents presented with more aggressive clinical features than adults. During median follow-ups of 28 months (range, 3-161 months) in children, 33 months (range, 3-152 months) in adolescents, and 48 months (range, 3-157 months) in adults, multivariate analysis showed that children and adolescents had higher probabilities of achieving complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, and molecular response4.5. Notably, compared with not only adults (cohort 3 vs. cohort 1: HR = 2.03 [1.03, 3.98], P = 0.040; cohort 4 vs. cohort 1: HR = 2.15 [1.07, 4.33], P = 0.033; cohort 5 vs. cohort 1: HR = 4.22 [1.94, 9.15], P < 0.001) but also adolescents (cohort 2 vs. cohort 1: HR = 2.36 [1.18, 4.72], P = 0.015), children had significantly longer failure-free survival. Age was not associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. Although they exhibited more aggressive clinical features at diagnosis, both children and adolescents achieved superior treatment responses than adults. Adolescents showed even more adverse features and a poor FFS than children.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The randomized, phase 3 ICARIA-MM study investigated isatuximab (Isa) with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) versus Pd in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and >=2 prior lines. This prespecified subgroup analysis examined efficacy in patients with renal impairment (RI; estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Isa 10 mg/kg was given intravenously once weekly in cycle 1, and every 2 weeks in subsequent 28-day cycles. Patients received standard doses of Pd. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with RI was 9.5 months with Isa-Pd (n = 55) and 3.7 months with Pd (n = 49; hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.85). Without RI, median PFS was 12.7 months with Isa-Pd (n = 87) and 7.9 months with Pd (n = 96; HR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88). The overall response rate (ORR) with and without RI was higher with Isa-Pd (56 and 68%) than Pd (25 and 43%). Complete renal response rates were 71.9% (23/32) with Isa-Pd and 38.1% (8/21) with Pd; these lasted >=60 days in 31.3% (10/32) and 19.0% (4/21) of patients, respectively. Isa pharmacokinetics were comparable between the subgroups, suggesting no need for dose adjustment in patients with RI. In summary, the addition of Isa to Pd improved PFS, ORR and renal response rates.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy resulting in increased definitive cure rates or extended disease-free survival in various malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases. However, because of the high risk of severe complications of this therapy, up to 50% of patients may require being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to manage life-threatening conditions. We aimed to evaluate the in-hospital mortality of allo-HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU and to identify those variables associated with in-hospital mortality. A 10-year (January 2010 to December 2019), single-center, retrospective study was conducted in Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona. We included all consecutive allo-HSCT patients who required admission to the ICU. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were registered. Severity scores and the need for organ support were also assessed on days 1, 3, and 5 of ICU admission. In-hospital mortality-associated independent variables were identified using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Three hundred twenty-three patients underwent allo-HSCT during the study period, of whom 82 (25%) were admitted to the ICU; 53 (65%) male, with a median age of 51 (38-59) years. Most patients received allo-HSCT for the treatment of lymphoma (20 patients [24%]) or acute leukemia (44 patients [54%]). The median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 23 (17-28), and the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission was 9 (7-11). Forty-nine (60%) patients died in the ICU, and 11 (13%) died in the hospital after being discharged from the ICU. Disease-related characteristics were not associated with mortality. Yet, SOFA score on day 1 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.04-1.02]; P =.002), the need for vasopressors on day 3 (HR: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.27-4.36]; P =.007), and a nondecreasing SOFA score on day 5 (HR: 2.13 [95% CI: 1.03-4.39]; P =.04), were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Mortality in allo-HSCT patients who require ICU admission remains high. In the present study, SOFA score, the need for vasopressors on day 3, and a nondecreasing SOFA score on day 5 predicted in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Risk factors and outcomes of GF after TCD haploidentical transplantation in children with hematological malignancies were analyzed. 148 TCD transplants were included. 78 patients were diagnosed of ALL and 70 patients of AML. 22 out of 148 patients developed GF. MVA showed that patient <9 years (HR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.1-23.0; p = 0.03) and pre-transplant CD8+ >=150/microL (HR: 12.0; 95% CI: 1.6-95.3; p = 0.01) were associated with GF. A score was assigned to each patient. The cumulative incidence of GF for patients with CD8+ >=150/microL (2 points) was 6 +/- 4% and 3 +/- 2% for patients <9 years (1 point) while for patients with 3 points was 24 +/- 6%, With a median follow-up of 48 months (range; 4-180 months), 14 (64%) of 22 patients with GF are alive and disease-free. DFS for GF patients was 53 +/- 12%. In conclusion, patient age and pre-transplant CD3+/CD8+ are associated with GF in children undergoing TCD haploidentical transplantation.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background Lenalidomide maintenance improves progression-free survival for patients with multiple myeloma, although its optimal duration is unknown. Clearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow results in superior outcomes, although its attainment or sustainment does not alter clinical decision-making. Studies that have evaluated MRD serially are limited in length. We therefore aimed to evaluate longitudinal changes in MRD-status (dynamics) and their association with progression-free survival in patients with multiple myeloma. Method(s): In this single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA) who had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following unrestricted frontline therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2 or lower, including patients who started maintenance before study enrolment. All participants received lenalidomide maintenance at 10 mg for 21 days of 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxic effects for up to 5 years on protocol. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 60 months per protocol and key secondary endpoints were MRD rates after completion of the 12th, 24th, and 36th cycle of maintenance and the association between progression-free survival and annual measurement of MRD status. MRD was assessed from first-pull bone marrow aspirates at baseline and annually by flow cytometry per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, (limit of detection of at least 1 x 10-5) up to a maximum of 5 years. Patients who completed at least four cycles of treatment were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint, and patients who had completed at least one dose of treatment on protocol were assessable for secondary endpoints. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02538198, and is now closed to accrual. Finding(s): Between Sept 8, 2015, and Jan 25, 2019, 108 patients (100 evaluable for the primary endpoint) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 40.7 months (95% CI 38.7-45.0). At 60 months, progression-free survival was 64% (95% CI 52-79). Median progression-free survival was unreached (95% CI unreached-unreached). MRD dynamics were assessed using 340 MRD assessments done over 5 years for 103 evaluable patients. Patients who sustained MRD negativity for 2 years (n=34) had no recorded disease progression at median 19.8 months (95% CI 15.8-22.3) past the 2-year maintenance landmark. By contrast, patients who lost their MRD-negative responses (n=10) were more likely to progress than those with sustained MRD negativity (HR infinite; p<0.0001) and those with persistent MRD positivity (HR 5.88, 95% CI 1.18-33.33; p=0.015) at the 2-year landmark. Haematological and non-haematological serious adverse events occurred in 19 patients (18%). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were decreased lymphocyte count in 48 (44%) patients and decreased neutrophil count in 47 (44%) patients. One death occurred on study due to sepsis and heart failure and was considered unrelated to the study drug. Interpretation(s): Serial measurements of MRD allow for dynamic assessment of risk for disease progression. Early intervention should be investigated for patients with loss of MRD negativity. Sustained MRD positivity is not categorically an unfavourable outcome and might portend prolonged stability of low-level disease.

N2  - The regimen of 5-azacytidine for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has remained unchanged since its first approval. Although several modifications have since been made and delays and dose reductions are common especially during the first treatment cycles, there are minimal data on the prognostic effect of these modifications. In this study, based on data from 897 patients with MDS treated with 5-azacytidine recorded in a national registry, the effect of treatment delays and dose reductions on response, transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia, and survival (after 5-azacytidine initiation, OST) were analysed. Delays during the first two cycles were noted in 150 patients (16.7%) and were found to adversely affect OST independently of the International Prognostic Scoring System score [hazard ratio (HR), 1.368; P = 0.033] or pre-existing neutropenia (HR, 1.42; P = 0.015). In patients achieving a response, delays before response achievement were correlated with its type (complete remission, 2.8 days/cycle; partial remission, 3.3 days/cycle; haematologic improvement, 5.6 days/cycle; P = 0.041), while delays after response achievement did not have any effect on retention of response or survival. Dose reductions were found to have no prognostic impact. Based on our results, treatment delays especially during the first cycles should be avoided, even in neutropenic patients. This strict strategy may be loosened after achieving a favourable response.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The optimal myeloablative conditioning (MAC) for patients undergoing haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) is unknown. We studied the outcomes of total body irradiation (TBI)-based versus chemotherapy (CT)-based MAC regimens in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study included 427 patients who underwent first haplo-HCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), following TBI-based (n = 188; 44%) or CT-based (n = 239; 56%) MAC. The median patient age was 32 years. Fludarabine-TBI (72%) and thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (65%) were the most frequently used TBI- and CT-based regimens, respectively. In the TBI and CT cohorts, 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 45% versus 37% (P = .05), overall survival (OS) was 51% versus 47% (P = .18), relapse incidence (RI) was 34% versus 32% (P = .44), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 21% versus 31% (P < .01). In the multivariate analysis, TBI was associated with lower NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.86; P = .01), better LFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98; P =.04), and increased risk for grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.34; P = .02) compared with CT-based MAC. The type of conditioning regimen did not impact RI, chronic GVHD, OS, or GVHD-free, relapse-free survival after adjusting for transplantation-related variables. TBI-based MAC was associated with lower NRM and better LFS compared with CT-based MAC in patients with ALL after haplo-HCT/PTCy.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) using a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) and cord blood transplantation (CBT) are valid alternatives for patients without a fully human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor. Here, we compared the allo-HCT outcomes of CBT versus single-allele-mismatched MMUD allo-HCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in acute myeloid leukemia. Method(s): Patients who underwent a first CBT without PTCy (N = 902) or allo-HCT from a (HLA 9/10) MMUD with PTCy (N = 280) were included in the study. A multivariate regression analysis was performed for the whole population. A matched-pair analysis was carried out by propensity score-based 1:1 matching of patients (177 pairs) with known cytogenetic risk. Result(s): The incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 6 months was 36% versus 32% (p = 0.07) and 15% versus 11% (p = 0.16) for CBT and MMUD cohorts, respectively. CBT was associated with a higher incidence of graft failure (11% vs. 4%, p < 0.01) and higher 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) (30% vs. 16%, p < 0.01) compared to MMUD. In the multivariate analysis, CBT was associated with a higher risk of, NRM (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.46-2.99, p < 0.0001), and relapse (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1-1.83, p = 0.05), which resulted in worse leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.12, p < 0.0001), overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.33-2.17, p < 0.0001), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.21-1.83, p < 0.0001) compared to MMUD. The risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (p = 0.052) and chronic GVHD (p = 0.69) did not differ significantly between the cohorts. These results were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. Conclusion(s): CBT was associated with lower LFS, OS, and GRFS due to higher NRM, compared to MMUD allo-HCT with PTCy. In the absence of a fully matched donor, 9/10 MMUD with PTCy may be preferred over CBT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) boasts overall survival (OS) of >90% at 3 years and early mortality of <5% in recent clinical trials. Using a large National Cancer Database, we performed analysis of 7190 adults with APL to determine whether one-month mortality and OS of patients with APL treated in real-world practices mirror outcomes noted in clinical trials. Only 64% of total patients received multi-agent therapy; 32% received either single-agent therapy or no therapy at all. One-month mortality was 6% for patients <=18 years, 6% for 19-40 years, 10% for 41-60 years, and 21% for >60 years. OS at 1- and 3-year were 81% and 75%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, age <= 40 years, treatment at academic center, use of multi-agent therapy, and diagnosis after 2009 conferred better OS. In this largest database study in APL till date, we demonstrated an overall improvement in OS over time but challenges still exist in translating successes of clinical trials to real-world practices.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) account for nearly half of those with the disease. Because they are perceived to be unfit for, unwilling to receive, or unlikely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy they represent an important unmet need. Tosedostat is a selective oral aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in phase I/II trials showed acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy. We report the only randomised study of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAC) combined with tosedostat (LDAC-T) versus LDAC in untreated older patients not suitable for intensive treatment. A total of 243 patients were randomised 1:1 as part of the 'Pick-a-Winner' LI-1 trial. There was a statistically non-significant increase in the complete remission (CR) rate with the addition of tosedostat, LDAC-T 19% versus LDAC 12% [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-1.23; P = 0.17]. For overall response (CR+CR with incomplete recovery of counts), there was little evidence of a benefit to the addition of tosedostat (25% vs. 18%; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37-1.27; P = 0.22). However, overall survival (OS) showed no difference (2-year OS 16% vs. 12%, hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.28; P = 0.8). Exploratory analyses failed to identify any subgroup benefitting from tosedostat. Despite promising pre-clinical, early non-randomised clinical data with acceptable toxicity and an improvement in response, we did not find evidence that the addition of tosedostat to LDAC produced a survival benefit in this group of patients with AML.

N2  - Survival for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy is unsatisfactory. Standard nonintensive therapies have low response rates and only extend life by a few months. Quizartinib is an oral Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor with reported activity in wild-type patients. As part of the AML LI trial, we undertook a randomized evaluation of low-dose ara-C (LDAC) with or without quizartinib in patients not fit for intensive chemotherapy. Overall, survival was not improved (202 patients), but in the 27 FLT3-ITD patients, the addition of quizartinib to LDAC improved response (P = .05) with complete remission/complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery for quizartinib 1 LDAC in 5/13 (38%) vs 0/14 (0%) in patients receiving LDAC alone. Overall survival (OS) in these FLT3-ITD1 patients was also significantly improved at 2 years for quizartinib 1 LDAC (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% confidence intervals: 0.16, 0.85, P = .04). Median OS was 13.7 months compared with 4.2 months with LDAC alone. This is the first report of an FLT3-targeted therapy added to standard nonintensive chemotherapy that has improved survival in this population. Quizartinib merits consideration for future triplet-based treatment approaches.

N2  - Background: ABL-class fusion genes other than BCR-ABL1 have been identified in approximately 3% of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and studies suggest that leukaemic cells carrying ABL-class fusions can be targeted successfully by tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We aimed to establish the baseline characteristics and outcomes of paediatric patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the pre-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor era. Method(s): This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included paediatric patients (aged 1-18 years) with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion (ABL1 fusion-positive, ABL2 fusion-positive, CSF1R fusion-positive, and PDGFRB fusion-positive) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia enrolled in clinical trials of multidrug chemotherapy done between Oct 3, 2000, and Aug 28, 2018, in which tyrosine-kinase inhibitors had not been given as a first-line treatment. Patients from 14 European, North American, and Asia-Pacific study groups of the Ponte di Legno group were included. No patients were excluded, and patients were followed up by individual study groups. Through the Ponte di Legno group, we collected data on the baseline characteristics of patients, including IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A/B deletion status, and whether haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had been done, as well as treatment outcomes, including complete remission, no response, relapse, early death, and treatment-related mortality, response to prednisone, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at end of induction therapy. 5-year event-free survival and 5-year overall survival were estimated by use of Kaplan-Meier methods, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was calculated by use of a competing risk model. Finding(s): We identified 122 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (77 from European study groups, 25 from North American study groups, and 20 from Asia-Pacific study groups). 64 (52%) of 122 patients were PDGFRB fusion-positive, 40 (33%) were ABL1 fusion-positive, ten (8%) were CSF1R fusion-positive, and eight (7%) were ABL2 fusion-positive. In all 122 patients, 5-year event-free survival was 59.1% (95% CI 50.5-69.1), 5-year overall survival was 76.1% (68.6-84.5), and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31.0% (95% CI 22.4-40.1). MRD at the end of induction therapy was high (>=10-2 cells) in 61 (66%) of 93 patients, and most prevalent in patients with ABL2 fusions (six [86%] of 7 patients) and PDGFRB fusion-positive B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (43 [88%] of 49 patients). MRD at the end of induction therapy of 10-2 cells or more was predictive of an unfavourable outcome (hazard ratio of event-free survival in patients with a MRD of >=10-2 vs those with a MRD of <10-2 3.33 [95% CI 1.46-7.56], p=0.0039). Of the 36 (30%) of 119 patients who relapsed, 25 (69%) relapsed within 3 years of diagnosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse in 41 patients who underwent HSCT (17.8% [95% CI 7.7-31.3]) was lower than in the 43 patients who did not undergo HSCT (45.1% [28.4-60.5], p=0.013), but event-free survival and overall survival did not differ between these two groups. Interpretation(s): Children with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have poor outcomes when treated with regimens that do not contain a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, despite the use of high-risk chemotherapy regimens and frequent HSCT upon first remission. Our findings provide a reference for evaluating the potential benefit of first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment in patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

N2  - Although it is well known that tumor site- or bone marrow-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) might be correlated with worse outcomes in solid tumors and acute leukemias by promoting immune surveillance escape, their contribution to the immediate post-allogeneic transplantation phase by peripheral blood (PB) allografts remains unclear. Moreover, the Treg content in stem cells harvested from PB has been suggested to be correlated with acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD) and immunologic recovery after allogeneic PB stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the graft content of Tregs, as graft CD3+/Tregs ratio (gCD3/TregsR), on acute GVHD and post-allo-PBSCT outcomes. We prospectively enrolled 94 consecutive patients at 9 Italian centers of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) with acute myelogenous (n = 71; 75%) or lymphoblastic (n = 23; 25%) leukemia in complete remission who underwent matched related donor (n = 35; 37%) or unrelated donor (n = 59; 63%) allo-PBSCT. The median graft CD3+ cell, Treg, and gCD3/TregsR values were 196 x 106/kg body weight (range, 17 to 666 x 106/kg), 3 x 106/kg (range, 0.1 to 35 x 106/kg), and 71 (range, 1 to 1883), respectively. The discriminatory power of the gCD3/TregsR value to predict grade >=II aGVHD was assessed by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Any grade and grade >=II aGVHD occurred in 24 (26%) and 17 (18%) allo-PBSCT recipients, respectively. By ROC analysis, AUC (0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.608 to 0.866; P =.002) identified 70 as the optimal gCD3/TregsR cutoff value predicting the appearance of grade >=II aGVHD with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Patients were subdivided into a high (ROC curve value >=70) gCD3/TregsR group (HR; n = 48) and a low (ROC curve value <70) gCD3/TregsR group (LR; n = 46). The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in the LR group compared with the HR group (9% [4 of 46] versus 27% [13 of 48]) in both univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.44 to 16.17; P =.015) and multivariate analysis (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.34 to 18.93; P =.017), whereas no differences were documented taking into account aGVHD of any grade. The overall survival, disease-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse rates at 2 and 3 years were 61% and 54%, 62% and 55%, 15% and 23%, and 27% and 30%, respectively. Of note, gCD3/TregsR did not significantly correlate with relapse (P =.135). Taken together, our data from this prospective multicenter study confirm the value of Tregs in preventing aGVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia effect. © 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Disease heterogeneity is well documented, and patient stratification determines treatment decisions. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from risk-stratified AML are crucial for studying AML biology and testing novel therapeutics. Despite recent advances in PDX modeling of AML, reproducible engraftment of human AML is primarily limited to high-risk (HR) cases, with inconsistent or very protracted engraftment observed for favorable-risk (FR) and intermediate-risk (IR) patients. We used NSGS mice to characterize the engraftment robustness/kinetics of 28 AML patient samples grouped according to molecular/ cytogenetic classification and assessed whether the orthotopic coadministration of patientmatched bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) improves AML engraftment. PDX event-free survival correlated well with the predictable prognosis of risk-stratified AML patients. The majority (85-94%) of the mice were engrafted in bone marrow (BM) independently of the risk group, although HR AML patients showed engraftment levels that were significantly superior to those of FR or IR AML patients. Importantly, the engraftment levels observed in NSGS mice by week 6 remained stable over time. Serial transplantation and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays revealed long-term engraftment limited to HR AML patients, fitter leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in HR AML samples, and the presence of AML LICs in the CD342 leukemic fraction, regardless of the risk group. Finally, orthotopic coadministration of patient-matched BM MSCs and AML cells was dispensable for BM engraftment levels but favored peripheralization of engrafted AML cells. This comprehensive characterization of human AML engraftment in NSGS mice offers a valuable platform for in vivo testing of targeted therapies in risk-stratified AML patient samples.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Multiple available combinations of proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators (IMIDs), and monoclonal antibodies are shifting the relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) treatment landscape. Lack of head-to-head trials of triplet regimens highlights the need for real-world (RW) evidence. We conducted an RW comparative effectiveness analysis of bortezomib (V), carfilzomib (K), ixazomib (I), and daratumumab (D) combined with either lenalidomide or pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd or Pd) in RRMM. A retrospective cohort of patients initiating triplet regimens in line of therapy (LOT) >= 2 on/after 1/1/2014 was followed between 1/2007 and 3/2018 in Optum's deidentified US electronic health records database. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods; regimens were compared using covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Seven hundred forty-one patients (820 patient LOTs) with an Rd backbone (VRd, n = 349; KRd, n = 218; DRd, n = 99; IRd, n = 154) and 348 patients (392 patient LOTs) with a Pd backbone (VPd, n = 52; KPd, n = 146; DPd, n = 149; IPd, n = 45) in LOTs >=2 were identified. More patients >=75 years received IRd (39.6%), IPd (37.8%), and VRd (36.7%) than other triplets. More patients receiving VRd/VPd were in LOT2 vs other triplets. Unadjusted median TTNT in LOT >= 2: VRd, 13.9; KRd, 8.7; IRd, 11.4; DRd, not estimable (NE); and VPd, 12.0; KPd, 6.7; IPd, 9.5 months; DPd, NE. In covariate-adjusted analysis, only KRd vs DRd was associated with a significantly higher risk of next LOT initiation/death (HR 1.72; P = 0.0142); no Pd triplet was significantly different vs DPd in LOT >= 2. Our data highlight important efficacy/effectiveness gaps between results observed in phase 3 clinical trials and those realized in the RW.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate cytogenetic risk (ICR-AML) needs to be stratified and abnormal gene expression might be prognostic. PR/SET domain 16 (PRDM16) transcript levels were assessed in 267 consecutive adult ICR-AML patients at diagnosis by real-time quantitative PCR. 38.2% patients had PRDM16 transcript levels higher than the upper limit of normal bone marrow samples. Through ROC curve analysis and comparison of relapse-free survival (RFS), the optimal cutoff value of PRDM16 transcript levels was identified to group patients into high expression (PRDM16-H, 21.3%) and low expression (PRDM16-L). PRDM16-H was significantly associated with lower 4-year RFS and overall survival (OS) rates in the entire cohort, patients with normal karyotypes, FLT3-ITD (-) and NPM1 mutation (+)/FLT3-ITD (-) patients (all p <.05). Multivariate analysis showed that PRDM16-H was an independent adverse prognostic factor for RFS and OS in the entire cohort. Therefore, high PRDM16 expression at diagnosis predicts poor outcomes in adult ICR-AML patients.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - With limited data comparing hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes between myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) containing and non-TBI regimens in children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, the aim of this study was to compare transplant-outcomes between these regimens. Cox regression models were used to compare transplant-outcomes after TBI and non-TBI regimens in 624 children transplanted between 2008 and 2016. Thirty two percent (n=199) received TBI regimens whereas 68% (n=425) received non-TBI regimens. Five-year non-relapse mortality was higher with TBI regimens (22% vs. 11%, P<0.0001) but relapse was lower (23% vs. 37%, P<0.0001) compared to non-TBI regimens. Consequently, overall (62% vs. 60%, P=1.00) and leukemia-free survival (55% vs. 52%, P=0.42) did not differ between treatment groups. Grade 2-3 acute graft versus host disease was higher with TBI regimens (56% vs. 27%, P<0.0001) but not chronic graft versus host disease. The 3-year incidence of gonadal or growth hormone deficiency was higher with TBI regimens (24% vs. 8%, P<0.001) but there were no differences in late pulmonary, cardiac or renal impairment. In the absence of a survival advantage, the choice of TBI or non-TBI regimen merits careful consideration with the data favoring non-TBI regimens to limit the burden of morbidity associated with endocrine dysfunction.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Allogeneic HSCT represents the only potentially curative treatment for very high risk (VHR) ALL. Two consecutive international prospective studies, ALL-SCT-(I)BFM 2003 and 2007 were conducted in 1150 pediatric patients. 569 presented with VHR disease leading to any kind of HSCT. All patients >2 year old were transplanted after TBI-based MAC. The median follow-up was 5 years. 463 patients were transplanted from matched donor (MD) and 106 from mismatched donor (MMD). 214 were in CR1. Stem cell source was unmanipulated BM for 330 patients, unmanipulated PBSC for 135, ex vivo T-cell depleted PBSC for 62 and cord-blood for 26. There were more advanced disease, more ex vivo T-cell depletion, and more chemotherapy based conditioning regimen for patients transplanted from MMD as compared to those transplanted from MSD or MD. Median follow up (reversed Kaplan Meier estimator) was 4.99 years, median follow up of survivals was 4.88, range (0.01-11.72) years. The 4-year CI of extensive cGvHD was 13 +/- 2% and 17 +/- 4% (p = NS) for the patients transplanted from MD and MMD, respectively. 4-year EFS was statistically better for patients transplanted from MD (60 +/- 2% vs. 42 +/- 5%, p < 0.001) for the whole cohort. This difference does not exist if considering separately patients treated in the most recent study. There was no difference in 4-year CI of relapse. The 4-year NRM was lower for patients transplanted from MD (9 +/- 1% vs. 23 +/- 4%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, donor-type appears as a negative risk-factor for OS, EFS, and NRM. This paper demonstrates the impact of donor type on overall results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for very-high risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia with worse results when using MMD stem cell source.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Treatment of acute leukemia with intensive chemotherapy leads to an increased risk of myelosuppression. Luteinizing hormone (LH) blockade improves hematopoietic recovery in mice after radiation or chemotherapy, through protection of the hematopoietic stem cells which express the LH receptor. We hypothesized that LH blockade improves hematopoietic recovery following intensive chemotherapy in patients with leukemia. We conducted a retrospective analysis on pre-menopausal women with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received intensive chemotherapy and leuprolide given for abnormal uterine bleeding prevention or treatment. Given that leuprolide is more commonly administered in younger patients, we performed propensity score matching between the leuprolide (AML n=64; ALL n=49) and control groups (AML n=128; ALL n=98 patients). Patients with AML who received leuprolide had an additional increase of 13.8x109/L/year in their platelet count, and a 0.19x 109/L/year increase in their lymphocyte count after chemotherapy compared to control (P=0.02; P=0.03 respectively). Those with ALL who received leuprolide had an additional increase of 0.37x109/L/year in their absolute neutrophil count (P=0.02). In AML, leuprolide was associated with higher long-term hemoglobin levels (P<0.001) and less blood transfusions (mean, 23.9 vs. 34.7 units; P=0.002) compared to control. In a multivariate analysis, leuprolide was identified as an independent factor predicting improved hemoglobin levels, lymphocyte and platelet counts in AML. In conclusion, leuprolide use in leukemia patients receiving intensive chemotherapy was associated with improved long-term blood count recovery and with decreased transfusion requirements in AML.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - The impact of adverse risk genetic profiles on outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, we have profiled somatic mutations at diagnosis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 178 AML patients who received allogeneic HCT. NGS revealed 598 somatic mutations in 165/178 patients (92.7%). Frequently mutated genes include DNMT3A, TET2, NPM1, RUNX1, IDH2, and FLT3. Commonly detected cytogenetic profiles include normal karyotype, trisomy 8, monosomal karyotype (MK), deletion 5, complex karyotype (CK), and monosomy 7. In univariate analyses, TP53 mutation, MK, CK, and monosomy 7 were associated with decreased overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and a higher relapse incidence (RI). We defined adverse molecular-genetic profile as harboring at least one of the molecular/genetic abnormalities of TP53 mutation, MK, CK, monosomy 7, and deletion 5. The patients harboring adverse molecular-genetic profile (n = 30) showed a lower 2-year OS (24.9% vs. 57.9%; p = 0.003), RFS (23.7% vs. 57.9%; p = 0.002), and higher RI (47.2% and 17.2%; p = 0.001) after HCT when compared to patients without those lesions. Multivariate analysis confirmed adverse molecular-genetic profile as an independent prognostic factor, associated with decreased OS (HR 2.19), RFS (HR 2.23), and higher RI (HR 2.94).Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) have an increased risk of new malignancies. However, limited data have been published about the impact of CLL treatment on this risk. Here we followed a Danish population-based cohort of CLL patients for risks of new malignancies. Patients in the Danish CLL registry (2008-2017) were included. Up to 50 CLL-free matched comparators were identified. First-line treatment was categorized into four groups; bendamustine, chlorambucil, fludarabine or other. Patients were followed from CLL diagnosis for individual types of malignancy. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for new malignancies and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Overall, 4286 CLL patients and 214 150 controls developed 594 and 20 565 new malignancies respectively. Risk of new malignancies was increased for CLL patients. Chemotherapy treatment was registered for 1064 (25%) patients with CLL. Chemotherapy was associated with increased HR (1.51, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8) of any new malignancy. Specifically, fludarabine was associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (HR 4.93, 95% CI: 1.2-19.8). Patients with CLL are at increased risk of other haematological and solid malignancies compared to the general population. Chemotherapy exposure is associated with increased risk of second malignancies and fludarabine is associated with increased risk of MDS.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the combined impact of IKZF1 deletions/high expression of CRLF2 on the prognosis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2 expression were assessed in bone marrow samples from 117 children with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL. Sixteen (13.7%) patients were found to harbor IKZF1 deletions, which was associated with inferior outcomes. The event-free survival (EFS) for patients with high -CRLF2 expression was significantly worse than that for low -CRLF2 expression. Moreover, combined modeling of IKZF1+ /CRLF2 high identified 7.8% of cases as the highest risk subgroup (7-year EFS 33.3 +/- 15.7%). In a multivariate analysis, IKZF1+ /CRLF2 high remained a strong independent prognostic factor for EFS (HR: 14.263, p = 0.019). IKZF1 deletions and high -CRLF2 expression were associated with inferior outcomes, and the coexistence of IKZF1+ /CRLF2 high had a significant impact on an integrated prognostic model for high-risk BCP-ALL.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Structural chromosomal changes including copy number aberrations (CNAs) are a major feature of multiple myeloma (MM), however their evolution in context of modern biological therapy is not well characterized. To investigate acquisition of CNAs and their prognostic relevance in context of first-line therapy, we profiled tumor diagnosis-relapse pairs from 178 NCRI Myeloma XI (ISRCTN49407852) trial patients using digital multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. CNA profiles acquired at relapse differed substantially between MM subtypes: hyperdiploid (HRD) tumors evolved predominantly in branching pattern vs. linear pattern in t(4;14) vs. stable pattern in t(11;14). CNA acquisition also differed between subtypes based on CCND expression, with a marked enrichment of acquired del(17p) in CCND2 over CCND1 tumors. Acquired CNAs were not influenced by high-dose melphalan or lenalidomide maintenance randomization. A branching evolution pattern was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) 2.61, P = 0.0048). As an individual lesion, acquisition of gain(1q) at relapse was associated with shorter OS, independent of other risk markers or time of relapse (HR = 2.00; P = 0.021). There is an increasing need for rational therapy sequencing in MM. Our data supports the value of repeat molecular profiling to characterize disease evolution and inform management of MM relapse.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Since the introduction of lenalidomide into induction therapy for multiple myeloma (MM), there have been conflicting reports about its impact on autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. We evaluated the impact of previous lenalidomide exposure in a large cohort of patients with MM undergoing mobilization and collection at a tertiary stem cell transplantation center. We hypothesized that collection of PBSCs is feasible even with a prolonged duration of previous lenalidomide therapy. We examined patients with MM who attempted stem cell mobilization and collection, seen at our center between January 2012 and July 2015. The patients were categorized into 3 groups for analysis: (1) patients with previous receipt of >6 cycles lenalidomide, (2) patients with previous receipt of <=6 cycles of lenalidomide, and (3) patients without previous lenalidomide exposure. We compared collection yields and days of apheresis among the 3 groups using linear regression analysis. We identified 297 patients with MM who underwent mobilization of PBSCs. Of these, 35 had received >6 cycles of lenalidomide (median, 8 cycles; range, 7 to 25 cycles), 156 had received <=6 cycles of lenalidomide (median, 4 cycles; range, 1 to 6 cycles), and 106 had received no lenalidomide. Prior lenalidomide exposure did not have a statistically significant impact on the absolute number of CD34+ cells collected or on the duration of collection based on a multivariate linear regression analysis for association between receipt of >6 cycles of lenalidomide. In this retrospective analysis of MM patients undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation, we show that the duration of previous lenalidomide exposure does not impact the total number of PBSCs collected or the number of days of apheresis. These data suggest that longer courses of induction therapy with lenalidomide-containing regimens to achieve a maximum response can be safe without impairing the ability to collect PBSCs, and that limiting lenalidomide use before mobilization does not appear warranted in all cases.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Black and Hispanic children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have worse outcomes compared with White children. AML is a heterogeneous disease with numerous genetic subtypes in which these disparities have not been specifically investigated. In this study, we used the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database to examine the association of race-ethnicity with leukemia cytogenetics, clinical features, and survival outcomes within major cytogenetic subgroups of pediatric AML. Compared with White non-Hispanic patients, t(8;21) AML was more prevalent among Black (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28- 3.74) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.83). The poor prognosis KMT2A rearrangement t(6;11)(q27;q23) was more prevalent among Black patients (OR, 6.12; 95% CI, 1.81-21.59). Among those with KMT2Ar AML, Black race was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.41-3.79) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 2.54; 1.43-4.51). Hispanic patients with KMT2Ar AML also had inferior EFS (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.27-3.80) and OS (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.09-3.93). Similarly, among patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML (ie, core-binding factor [CBF] AML), Black patients had inferior outcomes (EFS HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14-3.28 and OS HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.60-6.57). This disparity was not detected among patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). In conclusion, racial-ethnic disparities in survival outcomes among young people with AML are prominent and vary across cytogenetic subclasses. Future studies should explore the socioeconomic and biologic determinants of these disparities.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - At diagnosis of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), there are conflicting data as to whether additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) beyond a standard Philadelphia (Ph) translocation confer a higher risk of subsequent disease progression. In the United Kingdom SPIRIT2 trial comparing imatinib 400 mg daily with dasatinib 100 mg daily, diagnostic karyotypes were available in 763 of the 814 patients recruited. Of these, 27 had ACAs in either/both the original 4 major route group (trisomy 8 or 19, iso17q or a second Ph) or the 5 additional lesions recently described (trisomy 21, 3q26.2, monosomy 7/7q2, 11q23, and complex karyotypes), and their progression rate was significantly higher (22.2%) than in patients without one of these ACAs (2.2%; P , .001). Patients with ACAs had worse progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR], 5.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59-10.50; P , .001) and freedom from progression (FFP; HR, 12.66; 95% CI, 4.95-32.37; P , .001) compared with patients without ACAs. No association was seen between the Sokal or European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival (ELTS) scores and the presence of ACAs. Univariate analysis showed that higher Sokal and ELTS scores and the presence of ACAs were associated with poorer PFS, though only ACAs and high-risk ELTS scores were associated with poorer FFP. Multivariable models identified both the Sokal/ELTS score and ACAs as significant independent factors for PFS but only ELTS score and ACAs as significant independent factors for FFP. The data support the view that certain ACAs are predictive of disease progression independently of Sokal or ELTS scores.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - With tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is now a chronic disease. CML patients treated with TKIs (n = 1200) were identified from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (de-identified claims and electronic health records) between 2000 and 2016 and compared with a non-cancer cohort (n = 7635). The 5-year cumulative incidence of all organ system outcomes was significantly greater for the TKI versus non-cancer group. In the first year, compared with imatinib, later generation TKIs were associated with primary infections (hazard ratios [HR] 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.00), circulatory events (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), and skin issues (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13-1.80); musculoskeletal and nervous system/sensory issues were less common (HRs 0.83-0.84, p < 0.05). Increased risk of infections, cardiopulmonary and skin issues associated with later generation TKIs persisted in subsequent years. In this real-world population, TKI therapy was associated with a high burden of adverse events. Later generation TKIs may have greater toxicity than imatinib.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is associated with inferior outcomes in the chemotherapy setting. We hypothesized that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)-based post-remission therapy would improve outcomes of this entity. We examined the frequency and long-term outcomes of adults with Ph-like ALL, particularly focusing on allo-HCT outcomes for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL. Ph-like ALL was determined by anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 344 patients, 57 (16.6%) had Ph-like ALL, 197 (57.3%) had Ph-positive ALL, and 90 (26.1%) had B-other ALL. To further evaluate the prognosis of Ph-like ALL, outcome analyses were restricted to 147 patients, excluding Ph-positive ALL. The actual allo-HCT rates in complete remission were 87.7% for Ph-like ALL, 71.4% for B-other standard-risk ALL, and 70.4% for B-other poor-risk ALL. Patients with Ph-like ALL had a higher 5-year overall survival (60.6% vs 27.1%; P = 0.008) than B-other poor-risk ALL subgroup, while no difference was observed compared with B-other standard-risk ALL subgroup. Similar results were noted in a separate analysis for patients receiving allo-HCT in complete remission. In multivariate analyses, B-other poor-risk ALL was associated with poorer outcomes. Our data showed that allo-HCT-based post-remission therapy may have contributed to non-inferior outcomes of adult Ph-like ALL.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Given the controversies in the prognostic value of KIT mutations and optimal thresholds and time points of MRD monitoring for AML with CBFB-MYH11, we retrospectively evaluated 88 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT, n = 60) or autologous HSCT (Auto-HSCT, n = 28). The D816V KIT mutation was significantly associated with post-transplant relapse, contrasting with other types of mutations in KIT. Pre- and post-transplant (3 months after transplant) CBFB-MYH11 MRD assessments were useful in predicting post-transplant relapse and poor survival. The optimal threshold was determined as a 2 log reduction at both time points. In multivariate analysis, the D816V KIT mutation and CBFB-MYH11 MRD assessments were independently associated with post-transplant relapse and survival. Stratification by D816V KIT and pre-transplant CBFB-MYH11 MRD status further distinguished the risk of relapse and survival. Auto-HSCT was superior to Allo-HSCT in MRD negative patients without D816V KIT, while Allo-HSCT trended to be superior to Auto-HSCT in patients with MRD positivity or the D816V KIT mutation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the differentiated prognostic value of the D816V KIT mutation in AML with CBFB-MYH11 and clarified optimal time points and thresholds for CBFB-MYH11 MRD monitoring in the setting of HSCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the most effective postremission therapy conferring the chance of cure for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including elderly patients. Although the number of transplantations for elderly patients with AML (eAML) is increasing owing to greater availability of various graft sources together with the adoption of advanced supportive care and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, there are relatively limited data on the impact of donor type in eAML compared to younger patients. In addition, few studies have evaluated the role of pretransplantation measurable residual disease (MRD) in the elderly population. Given the lack of prospective comparative study, we retrospectively compared transplantation outcomes of elderly patient with AML receiving allo-HSCT from matched sibling donor (MSD-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD-HSCT) or haploidentical related donor (Haplo-HSCT), or autologous HSCT (Auto-HSCT). A total of 154 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 60-74) underwent MSD-HSCT (n = 41), MUD-HSCT (n = 36), Haplo-HSCT (n = 55), or Auto-HSCT (n = 22) for AML. RIC regimens were used in the majority of patients. In Haplo-HSCT, T-cell-replete peripheral blood stem cells with unique RIC regimens using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-based GVHD prophylaxis was used. In the analysis, adjustment for MRD status at the time of transplantation was performed. MRD was measured by the quantitative molecular assays of the targets, including RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, and NPM1, or WT1 in the absence of abnormalities in the aforementioned targets. At a median follow-up of 48 months, survival rates were similar between different donor types, whereas nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower in MUD-HSCT compared to MSD-HSCT (P =.002). MSD-HSCT, in which the majority of patients received a conditioning regimen not including ATG, showed more frequent severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). The major causes of non-relapse deaths in MSD-HSCT were related to cGVHD (71%), whereas infectious complications were mainly related to NRM in Haplo-HSCT (50%) or Auto-HSCT (100%). In the MUD-HSCT, GVHD (57%) and infection (43%) contributed similarly to non-relapse death. Cytomegalovirus infection was more frequent in Haplo-HSCT. In multivariate models, pre-transplant MRD-positivity was an independent risk factor for relapse (P =.001), whereas older age (P =.002) and the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (P =.009) were useful in predicting NRM. The current study demonstrated comparable outcomes after alternative and matched sibling donor HSCT in eAML aged 60 years or older, and the results also suggest the necessity for more sophisticated strategies to reduce NRM or relapse according to each donor type. The usefulness of molecular MRD assays demonstrated herein will facilitate trials for MRD-driven decision-making or risk-adaptive approaches in eAML.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Despite comparable outcomes of haploidentical transplants (Haplo-HSCT) with HLA-matched unrelated transplants (MUD-HSCT) in retrospective comparisons, few studies have prospectively compared Haplo-HSCT with MUD-HSCT in AML. Here, we prospectively compared the outcomes of Haplo-HSCT with MUD-HSCT for AML in remission (n = 110) to prove non-inferiority of overall survival in Haplo-HSCT. Both groups were well balanced in factors related to biological features of AML and measurable residual disease (MRD) status by Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) assay. A unique, reduced-toxicity preparative regimen was used for Haplo-HSCT, whereas mostly-myeloablative regimen was for MUD-HSCT. Both groups showed similar patterns of neutrophil and platelet recovery, whereas delayed T-cell reconstitution in Haplo-HSCT was found compared with MUD-HSCT. No significant differences were found in acute or chronic graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) and post-transplant infectious events with an exception of EBV or CMV infection, which occurred more frequently in Haplo-HSCT. After a median follow-up of 47 months, no significant differences in overall survival (65% vs 54%, P =.146), disease-free survival (67% vs 53%, P =.142), relapse (20% vs 21%, P =.858), non-relapse mortality (14% vs 26%, P =.103), or GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (54% vs 41%, P =.138) were observed for Haplo-HSCT vs MUD-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, WT1 expression before transplantation independently predicted relapse, resulting in inferior survival. Separate analysis of unenrolled patients (n = 110) who were excluded or refused to participate in this study showed consistent results with enrolled patients. This prospective study demonstrated the non-inferiority of Haplo-HSCT to MUD-HSCT for AML in remission, and validated the role of WT1 quantification as an MRD marker (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01751997).Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - The impact of body mass index (BMI) on survival in lymphoma remains controversial. We leveraged a prospective cohort of lymphoma patients enrolled to SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource between 2002 and 2015 to assess the association of BMI before diagnosis, BMI at diagnosis, and BMI change over time with lymphoma-specific survival (LSS). A total of 4009 lymphoma patients (670 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 689 follicular lymphoma (FL), 1018 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and 1632 other subtypes) were included. Significantly shorter LSS after diagnosis was observed for FL patients who were obese before diagnosis (HR: 3.02, 95%CI: 1.43-6.41, p=.004) and for those with a >= 5% increase in BMI from diagnosis to 3-year follow-up (HR: 3.53, 95%CI: 1.22-10.2, p=.020). In contrast, obesity prior to or at the time of diagnosis was not associated with LSS in DLBCL and CLL/SLL. The impact of weight control after diagnosis in FL patient warrants investigation.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - CPX-351 is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (MRC-AML).We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of CPX-351 in a real-world setting in 103 patients from 12 French centers, including the evaluation of molecular abnormalities at baseline and minimal residual disease (MRD) in responding patients, compared with a historical data set from Bordeaux-Toulouse DATAML registry. A favorable safety profilewas observed, with a low frequency of alopecia (11%) and gastrointestinal toxicity (50%). The overall response rate after induction was 59%, and MRD,1023 was achieved in 57% of complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi) patients. Only the presence of mutated TP53 (P 5.02) or PTPN11 (P 5.004) predicted lower response in multivariate analysis. Interestingly, high-risk molecular prognosis subgroups defined by 2017 European LeukemiaNet risk stratification, including ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, were not associated with a significantly lower response rate using CPX-351. With amedian follow-up of 8.6 months, median overall survival (OS) was 16.1 months. Thirty-six patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation with a significantly longer median OS compared with nontransplanted patients (P,.001). In multivariate analyses, only spliceosome mutations were associated with better OS (P5.04). In comparisonwith intensive chemotherapy, there was no difference in OS for patients,60 years. These data confirm the efficacy and safety of CPX-351 in high-risk AML(t-AML and MRC-AML) in a real-life setting. CPX-351 is a treatment of choice for patients aged $60 years.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of myeloid cells with high levels of heterogeneity and great variability in prognostic behaviors. Cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations have been widely used in the prognostic stratification of AML to assign patients into different risk categories. Nevertheless, nearly half of AML patients assigned to intermediate risk need more precise prognostic schemes. Here, 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML and control samples and 206 genes representing the intratumor heterogeneity of AML were identified. By applying a LASSO Cox regression model, we generated a 4-mRNA prognostic signature comprising KLF9, ENPP4, TUBA4A and CD247. Higher risk scores were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, complex karyotype, and adverse mutations. We then validated the prognostic value of this 4-mRNA signature in two independent cohorts. We also proved that incorporation of the 4-mRNA-based signature in the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification could enhance the predictive accuracy of survival in patients with AML. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that this signature was independent of traditional prognostic factors such as age, WBC count, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying disparate outcomes in high-risk and low-risk AML patients were explored. Therefore, our findings suggest that the 4-mRNA signature refines the risk stratification and prognostic prediction of AML patients.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - We performed a nested case-control study to investigate the incidence, treatment, and prognosis of central nervous system (CNS) relapse after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and compared the outcomes of patients with CNS relapse following haploidentical donor (HID) HSCT versus identical sibling donor (ISD) HSCT. A total of 37 patients (HID-HSCT, 24; ISD-HSCT, 13) developed CNS relapse after transplantation between January 2009 and January 2019, with an incidence of 1.81%. The median time from transplantation to CNS relapse was 239 days. Pre-HSCT CNS involvement (HR 6.940, 95% CI 3.146-15.306, p <.001) was an independent risk factor for CNS relapse after allo-HSCT for AML. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for patients with CNS relapse was 60.3 +/- 8.8%, which was significantly lower than that in the controls (81.5 +/- 4.5%, p =.003). The incidence of CNS relapse was 1.64% for patients who received HID-HSCT and 2.55% for those who received ISD-HSCT (p =.193). There was no significant difference in OS between the HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT subgroups among the patients with CNS relapse. In conclusion, CNS relapse is a rare but serious complication after allo-HSCT for AML, and the incidence and outcomes of patients with CNS relapse are comparable following HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Disease relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a major cause of treatment failure for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Maintenance therapy after HCT for patients with targetable mutations such as mutated IDH1 or IDH2 may improve outcomes, and clinical trials evaluating this strategy are ongoing. However, clinical outcomes of IDH1- and IDH2-mutated AML patients after HCT have not been well described. The primary objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and post-HCT outcomes of IDH-mutated AML patients. Survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality. In this multicenter retrospective analysis, 112 adult patients with IDH1- or IDH2-mutated AML who underwent HCT and did not receive an IDH inhibitor as maintenance therapy after HCT were identified at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Ohio State University. Mutation testing was performed using next-generation sequencing panels. Patient characteristics were collected retrospectively, and their survival outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The median patient age was 64.1 years. The median follow-up was 27.5 months. Among patients, 78.5% had intermediate- or adverse-risk disease by European LeukemiaNET criteria. Fifty-eight percent of patients received intensive induction chemotherapy, 82% of patients underwent HCT during first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and 34% of patients received myeloablative conditioning. Frequently detected co-mutations were DNMT3A (35.7%), NPM1 (33.1%), and FLT3-ITD (13.4%); TP53 mutations were detected in 3.6% of patients. For IDH1-mutated patients transplanted during first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 75% and 58%, respectively. For IDH2-mutated patients transplanted in first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 64% and 58%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31% and 25% for IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cohorts, respectively. Multivariable analysis suggested first CR/CRi and age <=60 was associated with improved outcomes for IDH2-mutated patients. To date, this is the largest multicenter study of outcomes of IDH-mutated AML patients after HCT. Our analysis provides important benchmarks for analysis and interpretation of results emerging from clinical trials evaluating maintenance IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor therapy for AML patients after HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be more susceptible to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to age, disease, and treatment-related immunosuppression. We aimed to assess risk factors of outcome and elucidate the impact of CLL-directed treatments on the course of COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective, international study, collectively including 941 patients with CLL and confirmed COVID-19. Data from the beginning of the pandemic until March 16, 2021, were collected from 91 centers. The risk factors of case fatality rate (CFR), disease severity, and overall survival (OS) were investigated. OS analysis was restricted to patients with severe COVID-19 (definition: hospitalization with need of oxygen or admission into an intensive care unit). CFR in patients with severe COVID-19 was 38.4%. OS was inferior for patients in all treatment categories compared to untreated (p < 0.001). Untreated patients had a lower risk of death (HR = 0.54, 95% CI:0.41-0.72). The risk of death was higher for older patients and those suffering from cardiac failure (HR = 1.03, 95% CI:1.02-1.04; HR = 1.79, 95% CI:1.04-3.07, respectively). Age, CLL-directed treatment, and cardiac failure were significant risk factors of OS. Untreated patients had a better chance of survival than those on treatment or recently treated.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors' increased risk for adverse health outcomes could be mitigated through consuming a balanced diet. Nonetheless, >70% of adult survivors do not meet survivorship dietary recommendations. ALL treatment may amplify risk for restricted dietary preferences (picky eating) and poor self-regulation of food intake that could contribute to suboptimal diets in survivorship. This study aims to: (a) characterize differences in picky eating and self-regulation of food intake between survivors and peer controls; and (b) examine the associations between these eating behaviors and dietary quality in ALL survivors relative to peer controls. Method(s): Participants were children (5-13 years) with (n = 32) and without (n = 32) a history of ALL and their caregivers. Children's dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015) was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Caregivers completed the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Food Fussiness subscale and the Child Self-Regulation in Eating Questionnaire. Result(s): Independent samples t-tests revealed survivors exhibited greater picky eating than peer controls but comparable self-regulation of food intake. Bootstrapped grouped multivariate regression results showed that for ALL survivors, greater picky eating was associated with worse dietary quality (controlling for age and self-regulation of food intake). For peer controls, worse self-regulation of food intake was associated with poorer dietary quality (controlling for picky eating and age). Conclusion(s): Results provide preliminary support that different eating behaviors contribute to poor dietary quality in children with and without an ALL history. These findings suggest that interventions to improve ALL survivors' dietary quality may benefit targeting picky eating.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - We assessed the incidence and outcome of early candidemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The analysis included all first HSCTs performed from 2000 to 2015 in adult and pediatric patients with a non-leukemic disease and recorded in the EBMT registry. Overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse mortality (RM) were evaluated. Candidemia was diagnosed in 420 of 49,852 patients at a median time of 17 days post HSCT (range 0-100), the cumulative incidence being 0.85%. In 65.5% of episodes, candidemia occurred by day 30 after HSCT. The mortality rate by day 7 was 6.2%, whereas 100-day NRM was higher (HR 3.47, p < 0.0001), and 100-day OS was lower (HR 3.22, p < 0.0001) than that of patients without candidemia. After a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 5-year OS, NRM, and RM for patients with and without candidemia were 50.5% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.0001, 28.2% vs.18.8%, p < 0.0001, and 25.3% vs. 27.2%, p = 0.4, respectively. In conclusion, in non-leukemic transplant patients, the occurrence of an early episode of candidemia is rare but it is still associated with a negative effect on the outcome.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Intra-tumor heterogeneity portends poor outcome in many cancers. In AML, a higher number of drivers worsens prognosis. The Shannon Index is a robust metric of clonal heterogeneity that accounts for the number of clones, but also their relative abundance. We show that a Shannon Index can be estimated from bulk sequencing, which is correlated (rho = 0.76) with clonal diversity from single-colony genotyping. In a discovery cohort of 292 patients with sequencing of 43 genes, a higher number of drivers (HR = 1.18, P = 0.028) and a lower Shannon Index (HR = 0.68, P = 0.048), the latter reflecting clonal dominance, are independently associated with worse OS independently of European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk. These findings are validated in an independent cohort of 1184 patients with 111-gene sequencing (number of drivers HR = 1.16, P = 1 x 10-5, Shannon Index HR = 0.81, P = 0.007). By re-interrogating paired diagnosis/relapse exomes from 50 cytogenetically normal AMLs, we find clonal dominance at diagnosis to be correlated with the gain of a significantly higher number of mutations at relapse (P = 6 x 10-6), hence with clonal sweeping. Our results suggest that clonal dominance at diagnosis is associated with the presence of a leukemic phenotype allowing rapid expansion of new clones and driving relapse after chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is rare in young patients, especially before age 40 years at diagnosis, representing <2% of all patients with MM. Little is known about the disease characteristics and prognosis of these patients. In this study, we examined 214 patients diagnosed with MM at age <=40 years over 15 years, in the era of modern treatments. Among them, 189 patients had symptomatic MM. Disease characteristics were similar to older patients: 35% had anemia, 17% had renal impairment, and 13% had hypercalcemia. The staging was ISS-1 in 52.4%, ISS-2 in 27.5%, and ISS-3 in 20.1%. Overall, 18% of patients had high-risk cytogenetics [del 17p and/or t(4;14)]. Ninety percent of patients received intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant, and 25% of patients had allogeneic stem cell transplant predominantly at time of relapse. The median follow-up was 76 months, the estimated median overall survival was 14.5 years, and the median progression free-survival was 41 months. In multivariate analysis, bone lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 3.95; P = .01), high ISS score (HR, 2.14; P = .03), and high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 4.54; P < .0001) were significant risk factors for poor outcomes. Among predefined time-dependent covariables, onset of progression (HR, 13.2; P < .0001) significantly shortened overall survival. At 5 years, relative survival compared with same age- and sex-matched individuals was 83.5%, and estimated standardized mortality ratio was 69.9 (95% confidence interval, 52.7-91.1), confirming that MM dramatically shortens the survival of young patients despite an extended survival after diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology

N2  - Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) after myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorders is a high-risk category currently identified by the clinical history or specific morphological and cytogenetic abnormalities. However, in the absence of these features, uncertainties to identify the secondary nature of some cases, otherwise defined as de novo AML, remain. In order to test whether a chromatin-spliceosome (CS) mutational signature might better define the de novo AML group, we analyzed a prospective cohort of 413 newly diagnosed AML patients who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial (NILG AML 02/06) and who provided samples for accurate cytogenetic and molecular characterization. Among clinically defined de novo AML, 17.6% carried CS mutations (CS-AML) and showed clinical characteristics closer to sAML (older age, lower white blood cell counts and higher rate of multilineage dysplasia). Outcomes in this group were adverse, more similar to those of sAML as compared to de novo AML (overall survival, 30% in CS-AML and 17% in sAML vs. 61% in de novo AML, P<0.0001; disease-free survival, 26% in CS-AML and 22% in sAML vs. 54% of de novo AML, P<0.001) and independently confirmed by multivariable analysis. Allogeneic transplant in first complete remission improved survival in both sAML and CS-AML patients. In conclusion, these findings highlight the clinical significance of identifying CS-AML for improved prognostic prediction and potential therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation

N2  - Recommendations for dyslipidemia management aimed at reducing arterial occlusive events (AOEs) have been recently published. So far, no data have been reported on the management of dyslipidemia in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with nilotinib. We investigated 369 CML adult patients, stratified according to the new Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring system. Plasma levels of cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were measured prior to the start of nilotinib and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence of AOEs was 15.9%. Patients with cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dL and LDL > 70 mg/dL 3 months after treatment showed a significantly higher incidence of AOEs (21.9 +/- 4.6% vs 6.2 +/- 2.5, P = 0.003). Patients belonging to the high and very high SCORE risk group showed a significant increase of AOEs (34.4 +/- 6% vs 10 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, both high cholesterol and LDL levels and a high and very high SCORE risk remained significantly associated with the risk of AOEs (P = 0.008; HR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4-8.7 and P < 0.001; HR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2-9.8, respectively). Overall, 78 patients (21.1%) presented dyslipidemia at the time of CML diagnosis and 88 (23.3%) after starting nilotinib, but only 26 of them (29.5%) were treated with statins. Low LDL and cholesterol plasma levels are associated with a significant lower risk of AOEs in CML patients treated with nilotinib in the real life.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with great heterogeneity, and the data of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets in WM are limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical correlation and distribution of circulating T-lymphocyte subsets in newly diagnosed WM patients. We retrospectively searched medical records for 86 newly diagnosed WM patients. Comparisons of the absolute CD3+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD3C), CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD4C), CD8+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD8C), and CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio (CD4+/CD8+) as continuous parameters in different groups were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Young patients (<65 years) had lower ACD8C levels and a higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio. And the lower level of beta2-microglobulin (<3 mg/L) was associated with a higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio. With a median follow-up of 25 months, the univariate survival analysis showed that CD4+/CD8+ ratio inversion (CD4+/CD8+<1.5) was associated with shorter OS and PFS, and multivariate analysis confirmed that inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio could be an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Additionally, initial treatment with rituximab or bortezomib significantly improved the PFS and OS of CD4+/CD8+ inversion patients but did not affect normal CD4+/CD8+ patients. We show that low circulating CD4+/CD8+ ratio at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor in WM patients and that first-line therapy which included rituximab or bortezomib significantly improved PFS and OS for patients with CD4+/CD8+ ratio less than 1.5.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Maximizing the probability of antigen presentation to T cells through diversity in HLAs can enhance immune responsiveness and translate into improved clinical outcomes, as evidenced by the association of heterozygosity and supertypes at HLA class I loci with improved survival in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We investigated the impact of HLA heterozygosity, supertypes, and surface expression on outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent 8/8 HLA-matched, T cell replete, unrelated, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) from 2000 to 2015 using patient data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. HLA class I heterozygosity and HLA expression were not associated with overall survival, relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and acute graft-versus-host disease following HCT. The HLA-B62 supertype was associated with decreased TRM in the entire patient cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90; P = .00053). The HLA-B27 supertype was associated with worse DFS in patients with AML (HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.32; P = .00005). These findings suggest that the survival benefit of HLA heterozygosity seen in solid tumor patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors does not extend to patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. Certain HLA supertypes, however, are associated with TRM and DFS, suggesting that similarities in peptide presentation between supertype members play a role in these outcomes. Beyond implications for prognosis following HCT, these findings support the further investigation of these HLA supertypes and the specific immune peptides important for transplant outcomes.

N2  - POEMS syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder. Lenalidomide has recently emerged as a therapeutic option for POEMS syndrome. Cereblon has been identified as the direct target of lenalidomide, and high cereblon expression is associated with better response and outcome to lenalidomide therapy in multiple myeloma patients. Here, we analyzed the predictive value of cereblon, IKZF1, and IKZF3 in CD138+ selected plasma cells from forty-one newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone at both gene and protein levels. We found that patients with high cereblon expression tended to achieve better hematologic response compared to those with low expression (p = 0.024 for gene expression; p = 0.01 for protein expression). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed high cereblon mRNA expression as an independent prognostic marker for longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.542; 95% CI 0.337-0.871; p = 0.011). In conclusion, our results emphasized the role of cereblon mRNA expression as a unique biomarker for predicting the clinical response and outcome of lenalidomide-based therapy in newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: For acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the role of bridging consolidation chemotherapy after achieving first complete remission (CR1) in the transplant setting is a frequently debated issue. The lack of data from Asian patients led us to conduct this study. Method(s): We retrospectively studied outcomes of 106 patients in CR1 undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) based on their exposure to pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy. There were 35 in the no consolidation group versus 71 in the consolidation group. Result(s): The median relapse free survival (RFS) was 9 months for the no consolidation group and 51 months for consolidation group (p = 0.023). The median overall survival was 32 months for the no consolidation group and not reached for the consolidation group (p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis recognized consolidation and poor cytogenetics as adverse prognostic factors for RFS. Moreover, RFS was better in patients with a shorter time lapse between last chemotherapy and alloSCT in both the no consolidation group and the consolidation group. Consolidation chemotherapy did not negatively affect neutrophil and platelet engraftment, infection rates, or acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence. On the other hand, patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy showed trends towards a more severe degree of chronic GVHD. Conclusion(s): The exposure to consolidation chemotherapy in CR1 prior to alloSCT with RIC conditioning did not negatively impact the outcomes in Korean AML patients, for whom a suitable donor is rarely immediately available. Therefore, post-remission consolidation chemotherapy is a reasonable option if required.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

N2  - Statin use has been associated with reduced mortality from several cancers but also suggested, in vitro, to diminish the effectiveness of lymphoma treatments including rituximab. The present study aimed to assess the association of statin use with mortality in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We identified all incident NHLs and CLLs in Sweden from 2007 to 2013 with subtype information in the Swedish Lymphoma and Cancer Registers. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of pre- or post-diagnosis statin use (yes/no, intensity) with lymphoma-specific, cardiovascular, or all-cause mortality; and for follicular lymphoma (FL) by initial treatment strategy (active/watch-and-wait). Among 16 098 incident NHL/CLL patients, 20% used statins at diagnosis. Pre- and post-diagnosis statin use, and statin intensity were not consistently associated with any mortality outcome in patients with NHL, overall or for any subtype. For actively treated patients with FL, statin use did not appear to increase lymphoma-specific mortality (vs. non-users, HR [95% CI]after diagnosis 0.87 [0.45-1.67]). For CLL, statin use was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular but not consistently with lymphoma-specific mortality. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with improved lymphoma survival but appears safe to use during lymphoma treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is transforming the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), given its high efficacy in relapsed/refractory CLL as observed in both early-phase and randomized clinical trials. The present study aimed to determine whether venetoclax is effective and well tolerated in patients with CLL or Richter's syndrome (RS) in a real-world setting and to highlight factors impacting survival. Data from a venetoclax French compassionate use program were collected for 67 patients (60 with CLL and 7 with RS). Most patients presented adverse genetic features, such as TP53 disruption (74%) or complex karyotype (58%). Tumor lysis syndrome was observed in 14 (22%) patients, and 16 (24%) patients were hospitalized for grade III/IV infection. In the CLL cohort, ORR was 75 %, 1-year PFS was 61% (95% CI = 47-72%) and 1-year OS 70% (95% CI = 56-80%). No impact of TP53 disruption was noted while complex karyotype was identified as a predictor of both inferior PFS (HR = 3.46; 95% CI = 1-12; log-rank p = 0.03) and OS (HR = 3.2; 95% CI = 0.9-11.4, log-rank p = 0.047). Among the seven patients with RS, two achieved an objective response to venetoclax; however, the median OS was only 1.1 month. The well-balanced safety/efficacy profile of venetoclax is confirmed in this real-world setting. Complex karyotype should be evaluated as a predictive factor of survival for patients treated by venetoclax.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure hematologic malignancies but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although deaths during the first year after transplantation are often attributable to treatment toxicities and complications, death after the first year may be due to sequelae of accelerated aging caused by cellular senescence. Cytotoxic therapies and radiation used in cancer treatments and conditioning regimens for HCT can induce aging at the molecular level; HCT patients experience time-dependent effects, such as frailty and aging-associated diseases, more rapidly than people who have not been exposed to these treatments. Consistent with this, recipients of younger cells tend to have decreased markers of aging and improved survival, decreased graft-versus-host disease, and lower relapse rates. Given that umbilical cord blood (UCB) is the youngest donor source available, we studied the outcomes after the first year of UCB transplantation versus matched related donor (MRD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies over a 20-year period. In this single-center, retrospective study, we examined the outcomes of all adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic HCT through the Duke Adult Bone Marrow Transplant program from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015, to allow for at least 3 years of follow-up. Patients were excluded if they died or were lost to follow-up before day 365 after HCT, received an allogeneic HCT for a disease other than a hematologic malignancy, or received cells from a haploidentical or mismatched adult donor. UCB recipients experienced a better unadjusted overall survival than MRD/MUD recipients (log rank P = .03, median overall survival: UCB not reached, MRD/MUD 7.4 years). After adjusting for selected covariates, UCB recipients who survived at least 1 year after HCT had a hazard of death that was 31% lower than that of MRD/MUD recipients (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.99; P = .049). This trend held true in a subset analysis of subjects with acute leukemia. UCB recipients also experienced lower rates of moderate or severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and nonrelapse mortality, and slower time to relapse. UCB and MRD/MUD recipients experienced similar rates of grade 2-4 acute GVHD, chronic GHVD, secondary malignancy, and subsequent allogeneic HCT. UCB is already widely used as a donor source in pediatric HCT; however, adult outcomes and adoption have historically lagged behind in comparison. Recent advancements in UCB transplantation such as the implementation of lower-intensity conditioning regimens, double unit transplants, and ex vivo expansion have improved early mortality, making UCB an increasingly attractive donor source for adults; furthermore, our findings suggest that UCB may actually be a preferred donor source for mitigating late effects of HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Racial/ethnic differences in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survival have focused on non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB), often excluding Hispanics/Latinos. To further assess these racial/ethnic survival differences, we identified incident DLBCL cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 (n = 404; NHW = 136, NHB = 106, Hispanic/Latino = 162) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). All-cause mortality survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between demographic/clinical factors and all-cause mortality. Hispanic/Latino patients experienced 52% lower risk of mortality compared to NHWs (HR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.28-0.83), after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors. This reduced risk experienced by Hispanics/Latinos was similarly observed by age at diagnosis (<=60 years, >60 years), stage (I/II, III/IV), and receipt of chemotherapy. NHBs and NHWs experienced similar risk of mortality (HR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.52-1.40). Overall, among DLBCL patients, Hispanics/Latinos had improved survival compared to NHWs. Additional research should seek to identify the drivers of this survival benefit.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: Disease relapse remains the major cause of death among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). Maintenance treatment with FLT3 inhibitors and hypomethylating agents (HMA) has been studied in various clinical trials with mixed results. Objective(s): To synthesize the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of FLT3 inhibitors and HMA for maintenance therapy after allo-HCT in AML and MDS. Method(s): For this systematic review and meta-analysis Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception to March 2021 for studies on maintenance therapies after allo-HCT in AML and MDS. Studies were excluded if they were reviews, commentaries, case series with <5 patients, or basic research articles, not published in English, not on post-allo-HCT maintenance with FLT3 inhibitors or HMA in AML or MDS, or if they were clinical trials without published results or duplicate publications from the same patient cohort. Studies with insufficient reporting of the primary endpoint (2-year overall survival [OS]) and studies using FLT3 inhibitors or HMA for pre-emptive treatment of imminent relapse based on positive measurable residual disease testing were excluded. Random-effects models were used to pool response rates for the primary outcome of 2-year OS. Hazard ratios (HR) for death and relapse were calculated for studies that included a control group. Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were studied as secondary endpoints. Downs and Black checklist and risk of bias assessments were used to gauge the quality of individual studies. The study protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020187298). Result(s): Our search strategy identified 5559 studies. Twenty-one studies with a total of 809 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The 2-year OS rates were 81.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.8%-87.7%) and 65.7% (95% CI, 55.1%-74.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. In sensitivity analyses restricted to studies that included a control group, maintenance therapy with FLT3 inhibitors (HR for death = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.62) or HMA (HR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.66) appeared superior to no maintenance therapy. The 2-year RFS rates were 79.8% (95% CI, 75.0%-83.9%) and 62.4% (95% CI, 50.6%-72.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. Rates of any grade acute and chronic GVHD were 33.1% (95% CI, 25.4%-41.8%; grade 3/4: 16.5%) and 42.5% (95% CI, 26.3%-60.4%) among FLT3 inhibitor and 42.7% (95% CI, 33.5%-52.4%; grade 3/4: 8.1%) and 41.5% (95% CI, 32.0%-51.6%) among HMA-treated patients, respectively. Conclusion(s): Maintenance therapy with either FLT3 inhibitors or HMA after allo-HCT can lead to prolonged and improved OS and RFS with a favorable safety profile. Additional studies are needed to define the optimal duration of treatment, the role of measurable residual disease status, and transplant characteristics in patient selection.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option in Fanconi anaemia (FA). We analysed the outcome of children transplanted for FA between 1999 and 2018 in the UK. A total of 94 transplants were performed in 82 patients. Among the donors, 51.2% were matched related donors (MRD) while the remainder were alternative donors. Most patients received a fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy)-based conditioning regimen (86.6%) and in vivo T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab (69.5%). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 85.4% [70.4-93.2] with MRD, 95.7% [72.9-99.4] with matched unrelated donors (MUD), 44.4% [6.6-78.5] with mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD) and 44.4% [13.6-71.9] with mismatched related donors (MMRD) (P < 0.001). Other factors significantly impacting OS were pre-transplant bone marrow status, source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, preparation with Flu-Cy, use of total body irradiation (TBI) and alemtuzumab as serotherapy. In multivariate analysis, absence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukaemia, bone marrow as source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) other than +/- (Recipient/Donor) and Flu-Cy were protective factors for five-year OS. Five-year chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD)-free event-free survival was 75.4% with the same risk factors except for CMV serostatus. Five-year non-relapse mortality was 13.8% [7.3-22.3]. Only five patients (6.1%) developed grade II-IV acute GVHD and two patients chronic GVHD. These data confirm the excellent outcome of matched related or unrelated HSCT in children with FA.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Compared with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), myeloablative conditioning (MAC) is generally associated with lower relapse risk after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease-specific risk factors in AML/MDS can further inform when MAC and RIC may yield differential outcomes. We analyzed HCT outcomes stratified by the Disease Risk Index (DRI) in 4387 adults (age 40 to 65 years) to identify the impact of conditioning intensity. In the low/intermediate-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR], .74; 95% confidence interval [CI], .62 to .88; P < .001) but significantly greater relapse risk (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.76; P < .001) and thus inferior disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.33; P = .001). In the high/very high-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with marginally lower NRM (HR, .83; 95% CI, .68 to 1.00; P = .051) and significantly higher relapse risk (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.41; P = .002), leading to similar DFS using either RIC or MAC. These data support MAC over RIC as the preferred conditioning intensity for patients with AML/MDS with low/intermediate-risk DRI, but with a similar benefit as RIC in high/very high-risk DRI. Novel MAC regimens with less toxicity could benefit all patients, but more potent antineoplastic approaches are needed for the high/very-high risk DRI group.

N2  - Between 2004 and 2017, a total of 1123 adult patients (median age 65 years; 61% males) with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), not including acute promyelocytic leukemia, were seen at the Mayo Clinic. Treatment included intensive (n = 766) or lower intensity (n = 144) chemotherapy or supportive care (n = 213), with respective median survivals of 22, 9, and 2 months (p < 0.01). Intensive chemotherapy resulted in complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates of 44 and 33%, respectively, with no difference in survival outcome between the two (p = 0.4). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) was documented in 259 patients and provided the best survival rate (median 55 months; p < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 13 months, 841 (75%) deaths were recorded. Multivariate analysis identified age >60 years (HR 2.2, 1.9-2.6), adverse karyotype (HR 2.9, 1.9-4.9), intermediate-risk karyotype (HR 1.6, 1.02-2.6), post-myeloproliferative neoplasm AML (HR 1.9, 1.5-2.4), and other secondary AML (HR 1.3 (1.1-1.6) as risk factors for shortened survival. These risk factors retained their significance after inclusion of FLT3/NPM1 mutational status in 392 informative cases: FLT3+NPM1- (HR 2.8, 1.4-5.6), FLT3+/NPM+ (HR 2.6 (1.3-5.2), and FLT3-NPM1- (HR 1.8, 1.0-3.0).Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a complex, potentially fatal therapy featuring a myriad of complications. Triggering event(s) of such complications vary significantly, but often a so-called "multi-organ failure" (MOF) is reported as the leading cause of death. The identification of the exact trigger of MOF is critical towards early and disease-specific intervention to improve outcome. We examined data from 202 alloHCT patients reported to have died of MOF from the EBMT registry aiming to determine their exact cause of death focusing on veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) due to its life-threatening, often difficult to capture yet preventable nature. We identified a total of 70 patients (35%) for whom VOD/SOS could be considered as trigger for MOF and leading cause of death, among which 48 (69%) were previously undiagnosed. Multivariate analysis highlighted history of hepatic comorbidity or gentuzumab use and disease status beyond CR1 as the only significant factors predictive of VOD/SOS incidence (OR = 6.6; p = 0.001 and OR = 3.3; p = 0.004 respectively). VOD/SOS-related MOF was widely under-reported, accounting for 27% of deaths attributed to MOF of unknown origin without a previous VOD/SOS diagnosis. Our results suggest most missed cases developed late VOD/SOS beyond 21 days post-alloHCT, highlighting the importance of the newly revised EBMT criteria.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - We compared transplant outcomes of 708 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation using thiotepa/busulfan/fludarabine (TBF) conditioning with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (ptCy), to 2083 patients receiving matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation using fludarabine/busulfan (FB) conditioning and in vivo T-cell depletion. For intermediate cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in first complete remission (CR1), multivariate analysis revealed that haplo-TBF significantly increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.1; p = 0.0006) but did not affect relapse incidence (RI), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), or graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS). For high cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1, haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR = 2.7; p = 0.02), decreased RI (HR = 0.45; p = 0.03) but had no influence on LFS, OS, or GRFS. For AML transplanted in CR2, haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR = 2.36; p = 0.008), decreased RI (HR = 0.38; p = 0.005), but had no influence on LFS, OS, or GRFS. Finally, for AML patients transplanted with active disease, haplo-TBF had no influence on transplant outcomes. In conclusion, compared to MUD-FB, haplo-TBF increased NRM, reduced RI in high-risk AML in CR, resulting in similar LFS, OS, and GRFS. These results comparing two different approaches support the use of a haploidentical family donor for high-risk AML patients lacking a matched sibling donor.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Since cord blood transplantation (CBT) has been associated with high graft-versus-leukemia effects and a low incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we hypothesized that long-term outcomes might be better in CBT patients than in those given grafts from unrelated donors (UD). Therefore, we performed a landmark study comparing long-term outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients alive and disease-free 2 years after transplantation who received grafts from either CBT or UD. A total of 364 CBT recipients, 2648 UD 10/10 patients and 681 patients given grafts from UD 9/10 were included. Median follow-up was 6.0 years. Five-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) from transplantation was 86% in CBT patients, 84% in UD 10/10 patients (P = 0.36) and 84% in UD 9/10 patients (P = 0.86). On multivariate analysis, donor type had no impact on LFS. Similarly, no impact of donor type was observed on relapse incidence or non-relapse mortality. Factors associated with poorer LFS on multivariate analysis included higher age at transplantation (P < 0.001), male gender (P < 0.001), second complete remission (CR2) versus CR1 (P = 0.05), secondary AML (P = 0.01), antecedent of chronic GVHD (P < 0.001) and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.01). In conclusion, our study shows that long-term outcome for AML patients in CR two years after transplantation is not impacted by donor type.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - The indication for performing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in patients with isolated trisomy 8 AML in first complete remission (CR) is still debated. Here, we compared outcomes of such patients given either allo-HCT or autologous (auto)-HCT. Inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients with de novo AML, isolated trisomy 8, first HCT between 2000 and 2018, CR1 at transplantation, and either auto-HCT or allo-HCT with a HLA-identical sibling donor (MSD) or a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor (UD 10/10). A total of 401 patients met the inclusion criteria. They underwent an auto-HCT (n = 81), allo-HCT with a MSD (n = 186) or allo-HCT with a 10/10 UD (n = 134). At 3 years, relapse incidence, nonrelapse mortality and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 59%, 5%, and 37%, respectively, in auto-HCT recipients; 31% (P < 0.001), 14% (P = 0.04), and 55% (P = 0.033), respectively, in MSD recipients and 29% (P < 0.001), 13% (P = 0.15), and 59% (P = 0.03), respectively, in UD 10/10 recipients. In multivariate analysis, in comparison to auto-HCT, MSD and UD 10/10 were associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR = 0.47, P < 0.001 and HR = 0.40, P < 0.001, respectively) translating to better LFS (HR = 0.69, P = 0.04 and HR = 0.60, P = 0.03, respectively). There was also a similar trend for overall survival (HR = 0.73, P = 0.12 and HR = 0.65, P = 0.08).Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance (MT) post autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard of care in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) but has not been compared to other agents in clinical trials. We retrospectively compared bortezomib (BTZ; n = 138) or LEN (n = 183) MT from two subsequent GMMG phase III trials. All patients received three cycles of BTZ-based triplet induction and post-ASCT MT. BTZ MT (1.3 mg/m2 i.v.) was administered every 2 weeks for 2 years. LEN MT included two consolidation cycles (25 mg p.o., days 1-21 of 28 day cycles) followed by 10-15 mg/day for 2 years. The BTZ cohort more frequently received tandem ASCT (91% vs. 33%) due to different tandem ASCT strategies. In the LEN and BTZ cohort, 43% and 46% of patients completed 2 years of MT as intended (p = 0.57). Progression-free survival (PFS; HR = 0.83, p = 0.18) and overall survival (OS; HR = 0.70, p = 0.15) did not differ significantly with LEN vs. BTZ MT. Patients with <nCR after first ASCT were assigned tandem ASCT in both trials. In patients with <nCR and tandem ASCT (LEN: n = 54 vs. BTZ: n = 84), LEN MT significantly improved PFS (HR = 0.61, p = 0.04) but not OS (HR = 0.46, p = 0.09). In conclusion, the significant PFS benefit after eliminating the impact of different tandem ASCT rates supports the current standard of LEN MT after ASCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - About 20% of MM patients have T2DM. We assessed the impact of T2DM/pre-T2DM on MM progression and OS. We collected retrospective data of newly diagnosed MM patients in Maccabi health services, Israel, between 2012 and 2016. The study included 503 MM patients, median age 67.2 years (IQR: 33.5-91.2). Median follow-up was 32 months (IQR 19.4-47). T2DM and pre-T2DM were recorded in 24.1% and 51% patients, respectively. Median TT2T and OS in the cohort were 17.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 15-20) and unreached, respectively. T2DM patients had shorter TT2T (HR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.0-1.72, p=.047), particularly transplanted patients; 20.2 vs. 40 months (HR = 2.09, 95%CI 1.18-3.71, p=.012). In a multivariable model, T2DM had a borderline significant risk of all-cause mortality, adjusted HR 1.38 (p=.09). Pre-diabetes had no impact on TT2T or OS. T2DM predicted a shorter TT2T, particularly in transplanted patients, and tended to be associated with shorter survival.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are at excess risk for clinically significant COVID19 infection. BNT162b2 mRNA COVID19 (BNT162b2) vaccine provides effective protection against COVID19 for the general population, yet its effect in MM patients may be compromised due to disease and therapy-related factors and was not yet evaluated. This single-centre prospective study included MM patients tested for serological response 14-21 days post second vaccine. Vaccinated healthy volunteers served as controls. In all, 171 MM patients, median age 70 (38-94) were included; 159 active MM and 12 smouldering myeloma (SMM). Seropositive response rate (median titer) was 76% (91 U/ml) in active MM patients vs 98% (992 U/ml) in the 64 controls (P < 0.0001), and 100% (822 U/ml) in SMM patients. Multivariate analysis revealed older age (P = 0.009), exposure to >=4 novel anti-myeloma drugs (P = 0.02) and hypogammaglobulinaemia (P = 0.002) were associated with lower response rates. None of the novel agents significantly decreased response rate, whereas daratumumab trended towards reduced response (P = 0.08). Adverse events occurred in 53% and 55% of the MM patients and controls, respectively, all transient grade 1-2. In conclusion, BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and provided a high seropositivity rate in MM patients, independent of treatment type. Older, hypogammaglobulinaemic and heavily pretreated patients had lower response rates.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Elderly and frail patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are more vulnerable to the toxicity of combination therapies, often resulting in treatment modifications and suboptimal outcomes. The phase 3 BOSTON study showed that once-weekly selinexor and bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone (XVd) improved PFS and ORR compared with standard twice-weekly bortezomib and moderate-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with previously treated MM. This is a retrospective subgroup analysis of the multicenter, prospective, randomized BOSTON trial. Post hoc analyses were performed to compare XVd versus Vd safety and efficacy according to age and frailty status (<65 and >=65 years, nonfrail and frail). Patients >=65 years with XVd had higher ORR (OR 1.77, p =.024), >=VGPR (OR, 1.68, p =.027), PFS (HR 0.55, p =.002), and improved OS (HR 0.63, p =.030), compared with Vd. In frail patients, XVd was associated with a trend towards better PFS (HR 0.69, p =.08) and OS (HR 0.62, p =.062). Significant improvements were also observed in patients <65 (ORR and TTNT) and nonfrail patients (PFS, ORR, >=VGPR, and TTNT). Patients treated with XVd had a lower incidence of grade >= 2 peripheral neuropathy in >=65 year-old (22% vs. 37%; p =.0060) and frail patients (15% vs. 44%; p =.0002). Grade >=3 TEAEs were not observed more often in older compared to younger patients, nor in frail compared to nonfrail patients. XVd is safe and effective in patients <65 and >=65 and in nonfrail and frail patients with previously treated MM.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - There is no comparative health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) data of transplant eligible (TE) multiple myeloma (MM) patients undergoing early autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and those without in the era of novel drugs. This study prospectively evaluated the serial HR-QoL in TE-MM using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY20 questionnaires. Barring the transient worsening in QoL one-month after ASCT, there was a comparable improvement in most QoL domains in both early-ASCT and no-early ASCT cohorts. Post-early-ASCT patients had higher global health scores (71.9 vs. 60.8, p <.05) than no-early ASCT at 12-months. Patients belonging to lower socioeconomic status (SES) were more likely not to undergo ASCT than middle-high SES patients (38.6% vs. 74.5%, p <.05). While age, gender had no impact on QoL, performance status, staging, and induction therapy impacted QoL. This study shows that early ASCT maintains QoL and should be encouraged in all TE-MM patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease, and patients usually receive multiple lines of therapy. Due to the abundance of novel treatments for MM, we conducted a network meta-analysis to identify combinations that could fare better than others in relapsed/refractory MM, in the setting of novel drugs. We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for phase III trials in previously treated MM that had lenalidomide or bortezomib in the control arm. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), extracted as hazard-ratio. We used the P score to rank treatments. Thirteen studies were included. All but two studies compared one novel agent against two, with or without dexamethasone. Based on the P score, daratumumab and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin had a higher probability of achieving better PFS, followed by isatuximab, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and panobinostat. Although most overall survival data were not mature enough, the addition of a second or third novel agent to either immunomodulatory (IMID) or proteasome inhibitor (PI) backbone seemed to improve survival (HR = 0.84, 95CI 0.77-0.92). Severe adverse events were more frequent with isatuximab, panobinostat, and pomalidomide. In summary, in the absence of trials directly comparing two novel agents-based therapies, we provide a tool that indirectly compares these newer therapies and that can help physicians to prioritize some regimens over others.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: Ibrutinib therapy is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Risk assessment tools and outcomes of AF in these patients are not well described. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib at Mayo Clinic between October 2012 and November 2018. Result(s): Two hundred ninety-eight patients were identified with a median time on ibrutinib of 19 months (range 0.23-69.7 months). Fifty-one patients developed treatment-emergent AF; the risk of treatment-emergent AF at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years was 9%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of treatment-emergent AF on multivariable analyses: past history of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, p = 0.0072) and heart failure (HR 3.4, p = 0.0028). Most patients are able to continue ibrutinib therapy (dose reduced in 43%). Development of treatment-emergent AF was associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS; HR 2.0, p = 0.02) and shorter overall survival (OS; HR 3.2, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, prior treatment status, TP53 disruption, heart failure, valvular disease, and past history of AF. Conclusion(s): Patient comorbidities, rather than CLL-related factors, predict risk of treatment-emergent AF in patients treated with ibrutinib. Although the vast majority of patients with treatment-emergent AF are able to continue ibrutinib (with dose reduction in 43%), treatment-emergent AF appears to be associated with worse outcomes, independent of other adverse prognostic factors.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Combinations of the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, with either hypomethylating agents (HMA) or low dose cytarabine (LDAC), have shown promising results in clinical trials of AML patients unfit for intensive therapy. We report on the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in AML patients treated outside of clinical trials. Complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) were achieved in 61% of patients, with similar CR+CRi rates in with secondary AML, and in patients who were previously treated with HMA (61% and 43%, respectively). Relapse occurred in 25% of patients, with a median event-free survival (EFS) of 11.7 months (95% CI, 10.09-13.35) in responding patients. At a median follow up of 8.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months (95% CI 6.42-13.3) in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis adverse karyotype was the only negative predictor of CR/CRi (p =.03), while both ECOG performance status (PS) and adverse karyotype were significantly associated with shorter OS (p =.023 and.038, respectively). Median OS was higher in patients achieving CR/CRi and in patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Treatment was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those described in the randomized clinical trials. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 12% of patients. Our data support the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in newly diagnosed AML patients not eligible for intensive therapy. According to our data, secondary AML patients could benefit from venetoclax combinations similarly to de-novo AML patients, and allo-SCT could be offered to selected patients achieving CR/CRi.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - We have recently identified the G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor calcitonin receptor-like (CALCRL) as an independent prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in more than 1500 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we confirmed CALCRL expression as a prognostic factor in a cohort of 284 pediatric patients with AML. High CALCRL expression was independently associated with event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.57; P 5 .0001), overall survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.27; P 5 .025), and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.49-1.96; P, .0001) when adjusting for age, white blood cell count, and genetic risk. Despite its association with leukemia stem cell signatures, CALCRL expression remained associated with all end points when compared with the 17-gene leukemic stem cell score. The strong association of CALCRL expression with the risk of relapse also in the pediatric population supports its role as novel age-independent master regulator of relapse-initiating, drug-tolerant AML cells in humans.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

N2  - Prognosis in patients with post allogeneic HCT-early relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (<6 months post HCT) is dismal and response to salvage treatment is < 20%. In addition, majority of patients at this early point are unable to withstand intensive salvage chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the combination of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and venetoclax may result in increased response in this difficult to treat patient group. We retrospectively analyzed 22 patients from February 2017-December 2019, who were given the Venetoclax/DLI combination. Median age was 65 (43-75) years. There were no cases of tumor lysis syndrome. Microbiology documented infections occurred in 8 patients (36%). Majority were able to tolerate the protocol without admissions. Acute GVHD was observed in 4 (18%) patients and cGVHD was observed in 6 (27%) patients. Overall response was observed in 11 (50%) patients (CR, n = 4; CRi, n = 1; CRp, n = 4; MLFS n = 2). Median time to response was 28 (18-67) days and median cycles of venetoclax 2 [1-8] and duration of response were 135 (31-564) days. Median survival was 6.1 months (95% CI.73-11.4). Cox regression model for survival showed decreased WBC at relapse, GVHD and better performance status were associated with better survival. These results may endorse the hypothesis that enhancing alloreactivity combined with venetoclax is safe and efficacious and should be further investigated in prospective trials.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma (OS) require multidisciplinary treatment. Care at specialized cancer centers (SCC: Children's Oncology Group affiliated and/or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center) has been found to improve outcomes in patients with leukemia, but studies have not considered location of care and outcomes in EWS and OS patients, an ideal group to evaluate given their specialized multidisciplinary treatment needs. Method(s): Patients hospitalized with primary EWS and OS (2000-2014) were identified using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were divided into age groups (0-18, 19-39, >=40 years), and classified on whether they received all versus part/none of their inpatient treatment at a SCC within 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with survival. Result(s): There were 531 ES and 959 OS patients. Five-year overall survival was better for patients with EWS (all: 63% vs. part/none: 42%) and OS (all: 64% vs. part/none: 47%) who received all of their treatment at a SCC. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, receiving all inpatient cancer treatment at a SCC was associated with superior overall survival (EWS HR: 0.49, CI 0.37-0.67; OS HR: 0.78, CI 0.63-0.97). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that treatment for EWS and OS at a SCC is associated with significantly improved survival even after adjustment for known prognostic factors. The superior survival among those treated at SCCs may be due to having greater access to clinical trials and services at SCCs.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - In this population-based study, we used the SEER database (1985-2015) to examine survival outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients followed up to the era of advanced treatments including targeted therapies. Data were extracted for patients 15 years or older with a primary diagnosis of CLL. A period analysis was performed to estimate 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for patients diagnosed during different calendar periods from 1985 to 2015. A mixture cure model was used to examine long-term survivors' proportions among patients diagnosed in 1985-2015 and for two cohorts diagnosed in 2000-2003, followed up to 2012 and 2004-2007, and followed up to 2015. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for the two cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death adjusted for gender and age. The 5-year and 10-year age-adjusted relative survival rate ranged between 73.7 and 89.4% and from 51.6% to "not reached," respectively, for calendar periods of 1985-1989 to 2010-2014. The long-term survivor proportions varied by age and gender from 0 to 59%. The HRs (95%CI) for the 2004-2007 cohort in comparison to the 2000-2003 cohort were 0.58 (0.43-0.78), 0.58 (0.48-0.70), 0.57 (0.49-0.0.67), 0.68 (0.54-0.85), and 0.83 (0.68-1.02) for the age categories of 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and >= 85 years, respectively. Overall, relative survival improved significantly for CLL patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2015. These improvements were markedly better following the introduction of targeted therapies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) involves the second cause of death in low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) population. Prospective study to characterise the CVD and to identify predictors for the combined event (CE) cardiovascular event and/or all-cause mortality in transfusion dependent low-risk MDS patients. Thirty-one patients underwent a cardiac assessment including biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance (cMR) with parametric sequences (T1, T2 and T2* mapping) and myocardial deformation by feature tracking (FT) and were analysed for clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential mutations. Cardiac assessment revealed high prevalence of unknown structural heart disease (51% cMR pathological findings). After 2.2 [0.44] years follow-up, 35.5% of patients suffered the CE: 16% death, 29% cardiovascular event. At multivariate analysis elevated NT-proBNP >= 486pg/ml (HR 96.7; 95%-CI 1.135-8243; P = 0.044), reduced native T1 time < 983ms (HR 44.8; 95%-CI 1.235-1623; P = 0.038) and higher left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) (HR 0.4; 95%-CI 0.196-0.973; P = 0.043) showed an independent prognostic value. These variables, together with the myocardial T2* time < 20ms, showed an additive prognostic value (Log Rank: 12.4; P = 0.001). In conclusion, low-risk MDS patients frequently suffer CVD. NT-proBNP value, native T1 relaxation time and longitudinal strain by FT are independent predictors of poor cardiovascular prognosis, thus, their determination would identify high-risk patients who could benefit from a cardiac treatment and follow-up.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - While germline and somatic mutations in the gene PTPN11, encoding a phosphatase which regulates the RAS signaling pathway, are well characterized in children with Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, less is known about their clinical impact in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To elucidate the effect of PTPN11 mutations (PTPN11mut) on clinical outcomes, we screened adult patients with AML treated at our institution using targeted next-generation sequencing. Among 1406 consecutive patients, 112 (8%) had PTPN11mut. These mutations were more commonly associated with the acute myelomonocytic/monocytic leukemia subtype than was wild-type PTPN11, while none were detected in patients with core-binding factor AML. They co-occurred more commonly with NPM1 mutations and FLT3 internal tandem duplications and less commonly with mutations in IDH2 and a complex karyotype. Compared with the wild-type allele, PTPN11mut was associated with lower complete response rates (54% vs 40%; P = 0.04), and shorter overall survival (median 13.6 vs 8.4 months; P = 0.008). In a multivariate analysis, PTPN11mut independently increased the risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.25-2.29; P = 0.0007). In summary, mutations in PTPN11 have a characteristic phenotype in adults with AML and are associated with an adverse prognosis.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Introduction of novel salvage therapies and expansion of the donor pool within the past decade have allowed more patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) to receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). The impact of each salvage therapy on transplant outcomes have not been compared. Our primary objective was to determine post-HCT relapse-free survival (RFS) in adult patients with r/r Philadelphia-chromosome negative (Phneg) B-ALL. We retrospectively studied alloHCT outcomes in 108 adult patients with r/r Phneg B-ALL transplanted in morphological remission achieved by salvage therapy. Salvage therapies were chemotherapy-based combination (n = 45, 42%), blinatumomab (n=43, 40%), inotuzumab (n = 14, 13%), or CAR T cells (n = 6, 6%). The 2-year RFS and overall survival (OS) were 44% and 50%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, conditioning with reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-3.80; P =.003), having received >=3 lines of therapies prior to transplant (HR = 2.66, 95% CI, 1.56-4.54; P <.001), and inotuzumab (HR = 2.42, 95% CI, 1.14-5.12; Wald P value =.021) were independently associated with lower RFS. Blinatumomab (HR = 1.10, 95% CI, 0.62-1.96) had comparable RFS to chemotherapy. Incidence of hepatic sinusoidal syndrome was highest with inotuzumab (P <.001); however, 30-day mortality and intensive care unit admissions were not different per salvage therapy. The alloHCT in r/r Phneg B-ALL after remission induction with blinatumomab or chemotherapy led to encouraging outcomes if morphologic CR was achieved. In contrast, pretransplantation inotuzumab therapy was associated with inferior RFS. Larger studies are warranted to confirm our observations. Early transplantation after relapse and the utilization of myeloablative conditioning, when feasible, were key factors associated with improved outcomes after alloHCT in these patients.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

N2  - The post-transplant scoring system (PTSS), developed by the Francophone Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, is based on three independent post-transplant risk factors: grade of acute graft-versus-host disease, lack of platelet recovery before day 100, and relapse before day 100; discriminating low- (0), intermediate- (1-3), and high-risk (4-8) patients. We investigated the prognostic value of the PTSS in a cohort of patients with MDS who underwent myeloablative CD34-selected TCD transplants. From 2008 to 2018, 109 patients underwent a first TCD-HCT for MDS at our center. We used Cox proportional hazards models and different landmark analyses to evaluate the association of categorized PTSS score risk groups with overall survival (OS). Patients with an intermediate/ high risk PTSS score had decreased OS at day 180 (univariate HR 3.25 [95% CI 1.60, 6.60], p = 0.001) and at day 365 (univariate HR 5.42 [95% CI 2.21, 13.3], p < 0.001) compared to low risk PTSS scores. This association remained significant after adjusting for HCT-CI. PTSS score calculated at day 100 was not associated with OS, even after adjusting for HCT-CI subgroups. In summary, the PTSS predicted survival at day 180 and day 365 in recipients of T-cell-depleted allografts for myelodysplastic syndrome.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Richter transformation (RT) is defined as development of aggressive lymphoma in patients (pts) with CLL. The incidence rates of RT among pts with CLL range from 2 to 10%. The aim of this analysis is to report the frequency, characteristics and outcomes of pts with RT enrolled in trials of the GCLLSG. A total of 2975 pts with advanced CLL were reviewed for incidence of RT. Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data were pooled. Time-to-event data, starting from time of CLL diagnosis, of first-line therapy or of RT diagnosis, were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology. One hundred and three pts developed RT (3%): 95 pts diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (92%) and eight pts Hodgkin lymphoma (8%). Median observation time was 53 months (interquartile range 38.1-69.5). Median OS from initial CLL diagnosis for pts without RT was 167 months vs 71 months for pts with RT (HR 2.64, CI 2.09-3.33). Median OS after diagnosis of RT was 9 months. Forty-seven pts (46%) received CHOP-like regimens for RT treatment. Three pts subsequently underwent allogeneic and two pts autologous stem cell transplantation. Our findings show that within a large cohort of GCLLSG trial participants, 3% of the pts developed RT after receiving first-line chemo- or chemoimmunotherapy. This dataset confirms the ongoing poor prognosis and high mortality associated with RT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - This is a retrospective study of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who were >75 years old. We identified 394 patients and for non-trial patients (n = 350), immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)+dex (32%) was the most commonly used regimen followed by alkylator with steroids or other therapy (21%), alkylator + proteasome inhibitor (PI)+steroid (18%), and IMiD + PI + dex (13%). Overall, achieving >= very good partial response was more in patients receiving a triplet compared to other therapies (46% vs. 21%, p < 0.0001). Also, the median overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in patients who were treated with a triplet (median OS: 50.2 vs. 32.8 months, p = 0.0006). In a multivariate for OS, receiving a triplet (HR: 0.65, p = 0.02), not having an R-ISS stage 3 (HR: 0.36, p = 0.0003), and bone marrow plasma cell percentage <60% (HR: 0.69, p = 0.03) were predictive. In conclusion, being able to receive triplet therapy was associated with better survival in our MM patients >75 years old.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Hispanics and non-Hispanic (NH)-Blacks continue to face numerous health disparities related to multiple myeloma (MM). We aimed to analyze trends of MM-related hospitalizations and incidence of in-hospital mortality with a 10-year cross-sectional analysis of inpatient hospitalizations. The prevalence of MM-related hospitalizations was higher in NH-Blacks compared to NH-Whites (476.0 vs. 305.6 per 100,000 hospitalizations, p <.001). MM-related in-hospital mortality was higher in Hispanics compared to NH-Whites and NH-Blacks (6.2 vs. 5.3%, p <.001). Using average annual percent change (AAPC), we found a statistically significant decline of in-hospital mortality among all MM patients except NH-Blacks (AAPC: -2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7, 0.4, p =.47), who had the highest inpatient mortality in recent years. Multivariate analysis showed that NH-Blacks received fewer transplants, more blood product transfusions, fewer palliative care consults, less inpatient chemotherapy, and utilized more intensive care. Disparities in MM care for NH-Blacks and Hispanics continue to persist despite recent advancements in MM therapy.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Inflammation is a major hallmark of several cancers. The present study evaluated the prognostic value of the Fibrinogen-Albumin Ratio Index (FARI) at the diagnosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) treated with azacitidine (AZA). A retrospective study was conducted in a single cohort of 99 patients with de novo MDS and AML-MRC who were treated with AZA between May 2011 and June 2019 in our hospital. Plasma fibrinogen and serum albumin levels were measured before the start of AZA treatment. A total of 99 patients were included in the analysis. The optimal cut-off value of FARI for predicting the 1-year overall survival (OS) was determined by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be 0.079. A total of 59 (60%) and 40 (40%) patients had an FARI >=0.079 (high-FARI group) and < 0.079 (low-FARI group), respectively. The high-FARI patients had a significantly shorter OS than low-FARI patients (1-year OS, 35.6% vs. 77.5%, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, parameters with independent adverse significance for the OS were a high FARI (>=0.079) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-4.29; p = 0.006), and Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) very high (HR 1.483, 95% CI, 1.12-1.963, p = 0.006). A high FARI was found to be associated with a poor outcome in MDS and AML-MRC patients treated with AZA, and FARI was an independent prognostic factor for the OS in these patients. Further internal and external validations are needed to clarify the prognostic role of the FARI for MDS and AML-MRC patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

N2  - White blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis is the conventional prognostic factor in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of WBC at diagnosis considering the minimal residual disease (MRD) status at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We evaluated adult patients with Ph+ ALL who achieved negative-MRD and received HCT in first complete remission between 2006 and 2018. The entire cohort was temporally divided into derivation (n = 258) and validation cohorts (n = 366). Using a threshold of 15,000/muL, which was determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the derivation cohort, high WBC was associated with an increased risk of hematological relapse in both the derivation cohort (25.3% vs. 11.6% at 7 years, P = 0.004) and the validation cohort (16.2% vs. 8.5% at 3 years, P = 0.025). In multivariate analyses, high WBC was a strong predictor of hematological relapse in the derivation cohort (HR, 2.52, 95%CI 1.32-4.80, P = 0.005) and in the validation cohort (HR, 2.32, 95%CI, 1.18-4.55; P = 0.015). In conclusion, WBC at diagnosis with a new threshold of 15,000/muL should contribute to better risk stratification in patients with negative-MRD at HCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consolidation treatment options are between allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and chemotherapy, based on disease risk at the time of initial presentation and age. Measurable residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy could be incorporated as a useful parameter for treatment decisions. The present study evaluated treatment outcomes according to the next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD status and the type of consolidation therapy in patients with normal karyotype (NK)-AML. By sequencing 278 paired samples collected at diagnosis and first remission (CR1), we identified 361 mutations in 124 patients at diagnosis and tracked these at CR1. After excluding mutations associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis, 82 mutations in 50 of the 124 patients (40.3%) were detected at CR1. Survival benefit was observed in favor of allogeneic HCT over chemotherapy consolidation in the MRDpos subgroup with respect to overall survival (HR 0.294, p = 0.003), relapse-free survival (HR 0.376, p = 0.015) and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR 0.279, p = 0.004) in multivariate analysis, but not in the MRDneg subgroup. In summary, these data support allogeneic HCT in NK-AML patients with detectable MRD by NGS in CR1. Randomized clinical trials will be required to confirm this observation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: Despite the favorable survival rates of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), a significant number of patients present a dismal prognosis. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a marker of regulatory T cells, functions as a transcription factor involved in immune cell regulation, and its expression correlates with prognosis in many malignancies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the relative gene expression level of FOXP3 in childhood B-ALL and to detect its prognostic utility. Method(s): The study included 139 bone marrow samples obtained from 112 patients at diagnosis and 27 healthy children. Following extraction, RNA was reverse transcribed and the relative expression level of FOXP3 was quantified by quantitative PCR. Cytogenetics, immunophenotype, and minimal residual disease were analyzed according to international guidelines. Result(s): A highly significant overexpression of FOXP3 was detected in childhood B-ALL patients at diagnosis, which was associated with a stronger risk for disease relapse and patients' worse survival. Moreover, multivariate regression models highlighted the independent prognostic value of FOXP3 for childhood B-ALL. Finally, the combination of FOXP3 relative expression with clinically used disease markers clearly enhanced the prediction of treatment stratification. Conclusion(s): High FOXP3 relative expression was associated with inferior outcome suggesting its potentiality as a molecular prognostic marker to predict childhood B-ALL patients' outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Novel high-risk groups have recently been identified in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including Philadelphia-like, therapy-related, and measurable residual disease after induction therapy. Furthermore, modern targeted therapies have recently been incorporated into ALL management; rituximab for CD20-positive and blinatumomab for measurable residual disease after induction therapy or relapsed or refractory disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is recommended as consolidation therapy for high-risk ALL; however, its relative benefit for these high-risk groups and after novel therapies is unclear. We performed an analysis of posttransplantation outcomes in a cohort of 261 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL at the 3-site Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (January 1, 2008-December 31, 2018). With a median (range) follow-up of 22.4 months (0.5-135.0), the 100-day and 5-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality rates were 6.5% and 26.7%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and death were 22.6% and 46.2%, respectively. The 1-year estimate of the composite endpoint of graft-versus-host disease/relapse-free survival was 39.3%. We observed no associations of novel high-risk groups or modern targeted therapies with overall survival, nonrelapse mortality, or relapse in multivariable analysis. An increased risk of relapse was observed with T-ALL (hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.09; P = .02) and hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (hazard ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-7.62; P = .04). Our analysis suggests that novel high-risk groups derive a similar benefit from allo-HCT as traditional high-risk adult ALL and that novel targeted therapies do not seem to independently predict for posttransplantation outcomes. It also calls for further exploration of maintenance strategies after Allo-HCT to prevent relapse in high-risk subgroups.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy
