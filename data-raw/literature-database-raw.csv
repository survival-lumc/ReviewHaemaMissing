Interventions that result in improved OS after relapse are not well established. The efficacy of second cellular therapy and specific indications are matters of debate. This study was conducted to evaluate factors associated with postrelapse survival and the efficacy of a second course of cellular therapy. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with AML and MDS who underwent a first allo-HCT between 2010 and 2017 at our center but subsequently relapsed. One hundred and four patients with AML and 44 patients with MDS were included (total n = 148). Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell grafts were either unmodified or T cell-depleted (TCD) by CD34+ selection ex vivo. Forty-five patients (30.4%) received a second cellular therapy after relapse, either a second allo-HCT (n = 28; 18.9%) or donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) (n = 17; 11.5%). The median age at transplantation was 60 years (range, 24 to 78 years). The median time to relapse (TTR) after transplantation was 6.5 months (range, 1 to 60.9 months), and the ensuing median OS was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8 to 8.9 months). In univariable analysis, longer TTR, relapse type (measurable residual disease versus morphologic), relapse occurring in the most recent years, and receipt of cellular therapy after relapse were associated with better outcomes, whereas adverse cytogenetics and/or abnormality of TP53, as well as NPM1 mutation in patients with AML, were associated with adverse outcomes. Relapse type, year of relapse, and a variable resulting from the combination of TTR and receipt of second cellular therapy remained significantly associated with postrelapse survival in multivariable analysis. In a separate multivariable model, adjusted only for TTR, relapse type, and receipt of second cellular therapy, an adverse effect of NPM1 mutation on survival was confirmed. We could not show an effect of post-transplantation maintenance on survival after relapse. In both univariable and multivariable analysis, we found a positive association for second cellular therapy with survival after relapse in patients who relapsed early (<6 months) after allo-HCT and a similar trend in patients who relapsed late (>12 months) after transplantation. Two-year OS after a second cellular therapy was 44.9% (95% CI, 28.5% to 61.4%), and it was significantly better in patients with <5% BM blasts before cell infusion. We could not show different effects on survival after second cellular therapy for DLI versus second allo-HCT in univariable analysis. Survival after relapse is improving over time, but this remains a challenging event, especially for patients who relapse early after transplantation. We found that a second cellular therapy could offer a benefit even in these cases. Nonetheless, more research is needed to clarify the most appropriate treatment choices after relapse. These are probably driven by underlying genetic and immunologic conditions, which should be the focus of future studies.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","771.e1-771.e10","","9","27","","Transplant.

As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG2, we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG2 use. Procedure: Cases who received CPDG2 and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m2 between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG2 use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. Result(s): We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG2, 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m2 of MTX received CPDG2. Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG2. Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG2. Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG2 (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG2 use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG2. If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","e29036","","8","68","","Pediatr.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered as one of the most promising prophylaxis for severe GVHD. However, there are no prospective or retrospective studies determining whether they can work synergistically on GVHD. To investigate the potential influence of KIR matching and MSCs, and their synergism on aGVHD and cGVHD after allo-HSCT in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Data from 104 patients with AML and 50 patients with ALL treated with allo-HSCT in the transplantation unit were retrospectively analyzed. KIR genotyping was performed by the PCR-SSO method. The amplicons were quantified on the Luminex 200 flow analyzer and analyzed using the Quick-Type for Lifecodes software to generate KIR data. Cox proportional hazards models were used in multivariate analyses. KIR receptor-ligand matching was associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD compared to KIR receptor-ligand mismatching (p < 0.001) in AML patients, but KIR ligand-mismatching had no significant effect on aGVHD or cGVHD in ALL patients. In contrast, MSCs reduced the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD in both AML and ALL patients (AML: p = 0.006; ALL: p = 0.008) regardless of KIR mismatching. The combination of KIR receptor-ligand mismatch and MSC transplantation significantly suppressed grade II-IV aGVHD occurrence in AML patients (p = 0.039). In the KIR mismatch group, the incidence of aGVHD was 2.8% in patients receiving MSC compared to 14.6% in those who did not (p = 0.047). KIR receptor-ligand mismatch, MSC transplantation and their combined use significantly reduced the risk of aGVHD after allo-HSCT. These data provide a clinically applicable strategy to reduce aGVHD, thus improving allo-HSCT outcome.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","380-389","","3","39","","Hematol.

This study reports the efficacy and toxicity of sequential P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) and radiotherapy in a large Chinese cohort comprising of 202 patients diagnosed with early-stage ENKTL from six medical centers. The observed best overall response rate was 96.0% and 168 (83.2%) patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 44.1 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 74.6% and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis suggested that extensive primary tumor (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] 3.660, 95% CI 1.820-7.359, p < 0.001; OS, HR 3.825, 95% CI 1.442-10.148, p = 0.007) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >= 2 (PFS, 3.042, 95% CI 1.468-6.306, p = 0.003; OS, HR 3.983, 95% CI 1.678-9.457, p = 0.02) were independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes. Among the established prognostic models for ENKTL, the nomogram-revised risk index model had optimal prognostic risk stratification ability (PFS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001) and relatively balanced population distribution. The adverse events of this CMT were well-tolerated and manageable.

The results from the RICOVER-60 trial were subsequently confirmed in the following CHOP-R-ESC trials by a multivariate analysis adjusted for IPI factors and gender. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in EFS, PFS, and OS were seen between age groups (RICOVER-60). Hematotoxicity, infections, and TRM increased with age. TRM was significantly elevated in the age group 76-80 years. Therefore, this analysis shows that an age above 75 years defines an especially vulnerable patient population when being treated with chemoimmunotherapy for aNHL. Prophylactic anti-infective drugs are essential and clinically effective in reducing morbidity when treating elderly aNHL pts.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","1031-1038","","4","100","","Ann.

Possible approaches include low or high doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy), other chemotherapeutic agents, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone. The scope of the study was to compare low-dose Cy plus G-CSF versus intermediate-high-dose Cy plus G-CSF versus G-CSF alone for SC mobilization in MM, in terms of efficacy and safety. We retrospectively analyzed 422 MM patients undergoing SC mobilization in 6 Italian centers, including 188 patients who received low-dose Cy (LD-Cy group, defined as 2 g/m2), 163 patients who received intermediate-high-dose Cy (HD-Cy group, defined as >= 3 g/m2), and 71 patients who received G-CSF alone (G-CSF group). The median peak of circulating CD34+ cells was 77/microL in the LD-Cy group, 92/microL in the HD-Cy group, and 55/microL in the G-CSF group (P =.0001). The median amount of SCs collected was 9.1 x 106/kg, 9.7 x 106/kg, and 5.6 x 106/kg in the 3 groups, respectively (P =.0001). The rate of mobilization failure (defined as failure to collect >=2 x 106/kg) was 3.7% in the LD-Cy group, 3.4% in the HD-Cy group, and 4.3% in the G-CSF group (P =.9). The target SC dose of at least 4 x 106/kg was reached in 90.4%, 91.1%, and 78.6% of the patients in these 3 groups, respectively (P =.014). The ""on demand"" use of plerixafor was higher in the G-CSF group (76%) compared with the LD-Cy group (19%) and the HD-Cy group (6%). In multivariate analysis, G-CSF mobilization and previous use of melphalan or radiotherapy were independently associated with failure to collect the target SC dose of >=4 x 106/kg. No impacts of age, blood counts, or previous treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, or carfilzomib were observed. Our results suggest that LD-Cy may be considered for successful SC mobilization in patients with MM.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","244.e1-244.e8","","3","27","","Transplant.

However, the clinical relevance of serial molecular annotation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing active treatment is unknown. MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patients who had at least two NGS assessments were identified. Outcomes according to mutation clearance (NGS-) on serial assessment were investigated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of NGS trajectory on overall survival (OS). A total of 157 patients (MDS [n = 95]; sAML [n = 52]; CMML [n = 10]) were identified, with 93% of patients receiving treatment between NGS assessments. Magnitude of VAF delta from baseline was significantly associated with quality of response to treatment. Patients achieving NGS- had significantly improved OS compared to patients with mutation persistence (median OS not reached vs. 18.5 months; P = 0.002), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis (HR,0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.56; P = 0.0064). Serial TP53 VAF evaluation predicts outcomes with TP53 clearance representing an independent covariate for superior OS (HR,0.22; 95%CI = 0.05-0.99; P = 0.048).

Whether preemptive recombinant interleukin-2 (pre-IL2) is effective for patients with late-onset MRD (LMRD) remains unknown. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of pre-IL2 (n = 30) and pre-DLI (n = 25) for LMRD in patients receiving allo-HSCT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The 1-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 86.7% and 78.4% (P = 0.267), 83.3% and 75.6% (P = 0.329), the cumulative incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) at 100 days post-preemptive intervention was 3.3% and 12.0% (P = 0.226) in the pre-IL2 group and pre-DLI group, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 7.7% and 27.9% (P = 0.018), 13.6% and 20.0% (P = 0.561) and 3.3% and 5.5% (P = 0.321) in the two groups, respectively. No remarkable differences in CIR, OS, and DFS between the two intervention groups were found in multivariate analysis. The GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) were better in the pre-IL2 group than in the pre-DLI group (HR = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.76; P = 0.011). In conclusion, preemptive low-dose IL2 and preemptive DLI yield comparable outcomes for patients with LMRD receiving allo-HSCT, in terms of aGVHD, NRM, relapse, OS, and DFS. However, preemptive low-dose IL2 has a lower incidence of moderate/severe cGVHD and a higher CRFS. Preemptive low-dose IL2 may be an alternative method for patients who develop LMRD after allo-HSCT, particularly for patients who cannot receive preemptive DLI.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:16","2022-09-06 19:01:16","","517-527","","2","100","","Ann.

Previous prospective studies comparing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) versus reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have shown mixed results. In many of these studies, patients were not stratified based on measurable residual disease (MRD). We evaluated the effect of conditioning intensity on the outcomes of AML patients in complete remission (CR) with flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity. A total of 135 patients age 20 to 75 years with AML in CR1 or CR2 and flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity who underwent allogeneic HSCT at our center between 2011 and 2019 were evaluated. We compared overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of MAC (n = 89) and RIC (n = 46). Although the patients receiving RIC were older (62 versus 51 years; P < .0001), there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and European Leukemia Network risk criteria and disease status (CR1 or CR2) at the time of transplantation. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, no statistically significant differences in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 1.42, P = .411) or RFS (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.48 to 2.09, P = .99) were identified. The cumulative incidence of NRM (HR, 0.595; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.48; P = .2644) and relapse (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.23; P = .9872) was not different between the 2 groups. Grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were more frequent in the MAC group (39.3% verses 19.9% [P = .018] and 19.3% versus 2.3% [P < .001], respectively), as was moderate/severe chronic GVHD (23.6% versus 15.8%; P = .038). Our data indicate that conditioning intensity did not appear to affect OS, RFS, NRM, and relapse risk in patients with MRD-negative AML as measured by flow cytometry.

If each immunosuppressant differently affects natural killer (NK) cell function, the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch may be altered depending on the type of graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. To verify this hypothesis, the difference in the effect of KIR-ligand mismatch was retrospectively assessed between patients who received CBT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as GVHD prophylaxis comprising tacrolimus plus methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). In the MMF group (n = 1363), KIR-ligand mismatch augmented the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM; hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; P = 0.008), which worsened overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30, P = 0.0077). In the analysis of each KIR-ligand mismatch type, HLA-C2 mismatch had a favorable effect on relapse incidence (HR, 0.56; P = 0.0043) and OS (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) only in the MTX group. In the MMF group, HLA-A3/A11 mismatch worsened NRM (HR, 1.93; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 1.48; P = 0.014). These results imply that the effects of KIR-ligand mismatch differ with the type of GVHD prophylaxis and that assessing the KIR-ligand mismatch status is important for CBT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","3059-3067","","12","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\UVUZE4U4\Yokoyama H. et al. - 2021 - Altered effect of killer immunoglobulin-like recep.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexb&NEWS=N&AN=2013785685","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; mortality; adolescent; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; *graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; *graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; incidence; hazard ratio; relapse; *methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; *methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; *methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *cord blood stem cell transplantation; *prophylaxis; confidence interval; chronic myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; *killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; *mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; *mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; acute leukemia/th [Therapy]; *tacrolimus/cb [Drug Combination]; *tacrolimus/dt [Drug Therapy]; *tacrolimus/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; HLA antigen class 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, a mismatch of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand induces NK cell activation. Therefore, if CMV reactivation occurs in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch, it might improve CBT outcomes. We assessed the difference in the effect of CMV reactivation in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch on disease relapse in the graft-versus-host direction. A total of 2840 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Among those with a HLA-Bw4/A3/A11 (KIR3DL-ligand) mismatch, CMV reactivation up to 100 days following CBT had a favorable impact on relapse (18.9% vs. 32.9%, P = 0.0149). However, this effect was not observed in cases without the KIR3DL-ligand mismatch or in those with or without a HLA-C1/C2 (KIR2DL-ligand) mismatch. The multivariate analysis suggested that CMV reactivation had a favorable effect on relapse only in cases with a KIR3DL-ligand mismatch (hazard ratio 0.54, P = 0.032). Moreover, the interaction effect between CMV reactivation and KIR3DL-ligand mismatch on relapse was significant (P = 0.039). Thus, our study reveals the association between KIR-ligand mismatches and CMV reactivation, which will enhance CBT outcomes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","1352-1363","","6","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\PCH9MIYZ\Yokoyama H. et al. - 2021 - Reduced leukemia relapse through cytomegalovirus r.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010141830","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; major clinical study; male; mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; overall survival; acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; mortality; non relapse mortality; middle aged; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; multivariate analysis; calcineurin inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination]; calcineurin inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; *leukemia relapse; graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; recurrence risk; *cord blood stem cell transplantation; *Cytomegalovirus; *killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor 3DL1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor 3DL2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *virus reactivation; chronic myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously reported that Hispanic children with ALL had lower risk of fracture and osteonecrosis. To unravel the genetic root of such ethnic differences, we genotyped 449 patients from the DFCI 05-001 cohort and analyzed their ancestry. Patients with discordant clinical and genetic ancestral groups were reclassified, and those with unknown ancestry were reassigned on the basis of genetic estimates. Both clinical and genetic ancestries were analyzed in relation to risk of bone toxicities and survival outcomes. Consistent with clinically reported race/ethnicity, genetically defined Hispanic and Black patients had significantly lower risk of fracture (Hispanic: Subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.81; P = 01; Black: SHR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.75; P =.01), and osteonecrosis (Hispanic: SHR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.93; P =.04; Black: SHR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08-0.78; P =.02). The lower risk was driven by African but not Native American or Asian ancestry. In addition, patients with a higher percentage of Native American ancestry had significantly poorer overall survival and event-free survival. Our study revealed that the lower risk of bone toxicities among Black and Hispanic children treated for ALL was attributed, in part, to the percentage of African ancestry in their genetic admixture. The findings provide suggestive evidence for the protective effects of genetic factors associated with African decent against bone damage caused by ALL treatment and clues for future studies to identify underlying biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","451-458","","2","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\58YCFMQK\Yao S. et al. - 2021 - Genetic ancestry and skeletal toxicities among chi.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010821485","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; adolescent; child; cancer survival; pediatric patient; priority journal; event free survival; cancer patient; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer chemotherapy; hazard ratio; low risk patient; genotype; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; dexamethasone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; dexamethasone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *childhood leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hispanic; American Indian; Asian; Black person; *ancestry group; *bone necrosis/si [Side Effect]; *cancer genetics; *fracture/si [Side Effect]; African; asparaginase/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; asparaginase/dt [Drug Therapy]; asparaginase/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration]; asparaginase/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; asparaginase/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; confidence interval; ethnic difference; ethnicity; race","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of prophylactic DLI following haploidentical HSCT remains unclear. Here, 34 patients with high-risk acute leukemia who underwent low-dose anti-T-lymphocyte globulin-Fresenius (ATG-F)-based myeloablative haploidentical HSCT and prophylactic modified DLI (pro-DLI) were well-matched with patients without pro-DLI. The 5-year overall survival (OS) (67.8% versus 41.3%, P < 0.01) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) (64.6% versus 33.9%, P < 0.01) of pro-DLI cohort were superior to the control cohort. A slightly higher GVHD-free/relapse-free survival was found in the pro-DLI cohort (32.8% versus 16.3%, P = 0.32). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of the pro-DLI recipients was significantly lower than that of the control cohort (14.7% versus 49.3%, P = 0.01). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days after pro-DLI was 17.6% and 9.1%, respectively. There was no difference between the two cohorts in terms of the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD and non-relapse mortality. Data from the multivariate analysis demonstrated that pro-DLI was an independent protective variable for LFS (P = 0.01, hazard ratio {HR} = 0.35), OS (P = 0.01, HR = 0.32), and relapse (P = 0.02, HR = 0.33). Taken together, we demonstrate that pro-DLI after ATG-F-based HSCT effectively decreases the risk of relapse and improves long-term survival of patients with high-risk acute leukemia without increasing treatment toxicity.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","664-672","","3","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\N6VVRHQF\Yang L. et al. - 2021 - Prophylactic modified donor lymphocyte infusion af.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2007009062","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cyclosporine/cb [Drug Combination]; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; male; mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; overall survival; recurrence free survival; *haploidentical transplantation; acute graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; chronic graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; human cell; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; adolescent; *hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer survival; unclassified drug; busulfan/dt [Drug Therapy]; busulfan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *thymocyte antibody/do [Drug Dose]; busulfan/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; incidence; survival rate; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer mortality; cancer specific survival; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *myeloablative conditioning; busulfan/cb [Drug Combination]; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; leukemia relapse; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *donor lymphocyte infusion; cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; low drug dose; multiple cycle treatment; survival time; cytarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; disease free survival; clinical article; antileukemic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; *high risk patient; *prophylaxis; *thymocyte antibody/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; antileukemic agent/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cyclophosphamide/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; cytarabine/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; filgrastim/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; filgrastim/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]; methyl n (2 chloroethyl) n cyclohexyl n nitrosourea/cb [Drug Combination]; methyl n (2 chloroethyl) n cyclohexyl n nitrosourea/dt [Drug Therapy]; methyl n (2 chloroethyl) n cyclohexyl n nitrosourea/po [Oral Drug Administration]; methyl n (2 chloroethyl) n cyclohexyl n nitrosourea/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; risk reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are at least 3 donor options: a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and a haploidentical related donor (haplo); however, the optimal alternative donor type remains to be established. This study aimed to address how the outcomes of patients receiving these 3 alternative donor HCTs differ, and whether these outcomes change over time post-transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed Japanese nationwide transplantation registry data of adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic HCT while in first complete remission (CR) from an MMUD with a 7/8 match at the allele level (n = 601), with UCB (n = 1110), or from a haploidentical related donor (n = 221) between 2007 and 2018. For patients who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2014, the 3-year overall survival (OS) for the MMUD, UCB, and Haplo groups was 60%, 54%, and 47%, respectively (P = .022). For those who underwent transplantation between 2015 and 2018, the 3-year OS in these groups was 60%, 66%, and 63%, respectively (P = .693). Multivariate analysis revealed that the risks of both overall mortality and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were significantly lower in the later period than in the earlier period in the UCB group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [P < .001] for OS; HR, 0.64 [P < .001] for NRM) and the Haplo group (HR, 0.58 [P = .019 for OS; HR, 0.39 [P = .004] for NRM), but not in the MMUD group (HR, 1.07 [P = .631] for OS; HR, 1.26 [P = .175] for NRM). The results of a test for interaction showed a significant difference in the effect of transplantation period on OS and NRM between the MMUD and UCB groups (P = .014 for OS; P = .004 for NRM) and between the MMUD and Haplo groups (P = .034 for OS; P = .003 for NRM). These findings demonstrate the recent improvements in the outcomes of UCB and Haplo transplantations in patients with AML in first CR that have resulted in a similar OS in patients undergoing HCT with grafts from MMUDs, UCB, and haploidentical donors in the later period of the study.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","1005.e1-1005.e8","","12","27","","Transplant.

Japanese nationwide registry data for 6901 patients with AML and 2469 patients with ALL were analyzed. In this study, 2850 (41%), 937 (14%), 62 (1%), and 3052 (44%) AML patients and 1751 (71%), 265 (11%), 23 (1%), and 430 (17%) ALL patients underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR1), second CR (CR2), third or subsequent CR (CR3 +), and non-CR, respectively.

Multivariate analyses revealed that the risks of relapse and overall mortality were similar for AML patients transplanted in CR1 and CR2 (P = 0.672 and P = 0.703), whereas they were higher for ALL patients transplanted in CR2 than for those transplanted in CR1 (P < 0.001 for both). The risks of relapse and overall mortality for those transplanted in CR3 + and non-CR increased in a stepwise manner for both diseases, with the relevance being stronger for ALL than for AML patients. These results suggest a significant difference in the effect of disease status at HCT on post-transplant outcomes in AML and ALL.

Multivariate analyses revealed that lenalidomide treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.27, P = 0.003], intrathecal chemotherapy (IT; HR 0.54, P = 0.05), and radiation therapy (RTx; HR 0.33, P < 0.001) for CNS-MM had a positive effect on longer OS. These factors were used to develop a scoring system combining the number of treatments with lenalidomide, IT, and RTx (0, 1, 2, 3). The OS of CNS-MM patients was stratified based on these factors, with a median OS of 1.1, 4.5, and 7.5 months for patients with zero, one, two to three favourable features, respectively (0 vs 1, P = 0.0002; 1 vs 2-3, P = 0.08).

In the six-loci analysis, low HLA-allele matches did not significantly increase the overall mortality compared to higher matches, whereas in the five-loci analysis excluding HLA-DPB1, they caused a higher overall mortality (HR 1.42, p =.002), possibly due to the graft-versus-leukemia effect of HLA-DPB1 mismatches. A lower CD34+ cell dose (<.50 x 105/kg) resulted in higher mortality and lower engraftment; these inferior outcomes were offset by high HLA-allele matches (7-10/10 match), while the inferior outcomes of low HLA-allele matches were improved by increasing the CD34+ cell dose.

It is important to evaluate the early treatment response accurately to decide further treatment strategy. 18F-FDG PET/CT plays an important role in response evaluation and prognostic prediction in some kinds of lymphomas. However, data available regarding patients with ENKTL are limited. Thus, in this prospective study, we analyzed the prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in ENKTL. Thirty-four patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL were enrolled in this phase 2 study (NCT02825147, July 7, 2016). The patients received pre-, mid-, and end-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Deauville score (DS), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax), and the change in SUVmax (DELTASUVmax) were recorded for response assessment. The median follow-up period was 42.2 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 82.4% and 73.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that Ann Arbor stage (P < 0.002), mid-treatment DS (P = 0.005), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.001), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.004), end-treatment DS (P < 0.001), and end-SUVmax (P = 0.014) were prognostic factors for OS. Ann Arbor stage (P = 0.001), mid-treatment DS (P = 0.008), mid-SUVmax (P = 0.029), mid-SUVmax (P < 0.001), and end-treatment DS (P =0.021) were of prognostic significance for PFS. Multivariate analysis showed that mid-SUVmax (P = 0.042) and DS at the middle (P = 0.050) and end (P = 0.044) of treatment were significant independent predictors of PFS. 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for predicting the prognosis of ENKTL.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","1039-1047","","4","100","","Ann.

However, despite the high initial response rate, the majority of adult patients with B-ALL progress after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Data on the natural history, management, and outcome of adult B-ALL progressing after CD19 CAR T cells have not been described in detail. Herein, we report comprehensive data of 38 adult patients with B-ALL who progressed after CD19 CAR T therapy at our institution. The median time to progression after CAR T-cell therapy was 5.5 months. Median survival after post-CAR T progression was 7.5 months. A high disease burden at the time of CAR T-cell infusion was significantly associated with risk of post-CAR T progression. Thirty patients (79%) received salvage treatment of post-CAR T disease progression, and 13 patients (43%) achieved complete remission (CR), but remission duration was short. Notably, 7 (58.3%) of 12 patients achieved CR after blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab administered following post-CAR T failure. Multivariate analysis revealed that a longer remission duration from CAR T cells was associated with superior survival after progression following CAR T-cell therapy. In summary, overall prognosis of adult B-ALL patients progressing after CD19 CAR T cells was poor, although a subset of patients achieved sustained remissions to salvage treatments, including blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and reinfusion of CAR T cells. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to reduce risk of progression after CAR T-cell therapy and improve outcomes of these patients.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","531-543","","7","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\H228QB2T\Wudhikarn K. et al. - 2021 - Interventions and outcomes of adult patients with .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2014141142","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; male; overall survival; salvage therapy; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; human cell; cancer prognosis; fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; follow up; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; treatment outcome; event free survival; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; multiple organ failure/si [Side Effect]; remission; drug safety; disease burden; clinical article; cancer immunotherapy; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; intensive care; phase 1 clinical trial; lactate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *CD19 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *chimeric antigen receptor immunotherapy; blinatumomab/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; blinatumomab/dt [Drug Therapy]; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell; corticosteroid therapy; corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy]; cytopenia/si [Side Effect]; disease duration; inotuzumab ozogamicin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; inotuzumab ozogamicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; liver venoocclusive disease/si [Side Effect]; retreatment; tocilizumab/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both anemia and MDS per se may directly contribute to impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this study, we aimed to investigate the anemia-independent impact of MDS on HRQoL. We evaluated participants (>= 50 years) from the large population-based Lifelines cohort (N = 44,694, mean age 59.0 +/- 7.4 years, 43.6% male) and the European MDS Registry (EUMDS) (N = 1538, mean age 73.4 +/- 9.0 years, 63.0% male), which comprises a cohort of lower-risk MDS patients. To enable comparison concerning HRQoL, SF-36 scores measured in Lifelines were converted to EQ-5D-3L index (range 0-1) and dimension scores. Lower-risk MDS patients had significantly lower HRQoL than those from the Lifelines cohort, as illustrated in both the index score and in the five different dimensions. Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that MDS had an adjusted total impact on the EQ-5D index score (B = - 0.12, p < 0.001) and an anemia-independent ""direct"" impact (B = - 0.10, p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an anemia-independent impact of MDS in the dimension mobility, self-care, usual activities, and anxiety/depression (all except pain/discomfort). This study demonstrates that the major part of the negative impact of lower-risk MDS on HRQoL is not mediated via anemia. Thus, the therapeutic focus should include treatment strategies directed at underlying pathogenic mechanisms to improve HRQoL, rather than aiming predominantly at increasing hemoglobin levels.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:17","2022-09-06 19:01:17","","2921-2932","","12","100","","Ann.

We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of muscle quality in multiple myeloma (MM), a hematologic cancer of older adults, undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT). Healthy muscle was quantified by measuring the percent of high-density muscle within the L3 psoas muscle using a novel computed tomography method in 142 eligible patients. Early post-transplant complications were assessed in the first 100 days after transplant. Sarcopenia, defined as <=80% high-density muscle, was found in 72 (51%) patients. Sarcopenic obesity, defined as sarcopenia and a BMI >= 30, was found in 32 (23%) patients. One or more early complications occurred in 22 (16%) patients. Cardiovascular events accounted for 36% of all complications. Patients with sarcopenia had more cardiac complications (12.5%) than patients without (2.9%, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis revealed increased BMI at transplant, but not sarcopenia, was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.22, p = 0.02). Our analysis suggests that sarcopenia is prevalent in MM and associated with increased early post-transplant cardiovascular complications in MM.

The present study was done in an attempt to resolve the issue. The effect of gender was examined on 3546 newly diagnosed patients with AML, including 548 patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) enrolled in 10 multi-institutional treatment studies from March 1984 to November 2008. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to estimate event-time distributions for survival and multivariate models were used to examine the gender effect after adjusting for multiple risk factors. P values were based on two-sided tests. Non-APL female patients had a significantly better overall (OS) but not disease-free survival (DFS) than males, irrespective of age, initial white blood cell count, or dose of daunorubicin. No differences were observed for obese or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive patients. Female patients with APL had a significantly better OS and DFS than male patients with APL, and differences in survival were greater for patients with t(15;17) + other cytogenetic abnormalities compared with those with t(15;17) only. Gender is an independent prognostic variable in patients with AML. Whether these survival differences are due to hormonal, genetic or pharmacokinetic differences between the sexes or differential toxin exposure such as smoking is unknown.

An assessment of prognostic factors is an important part of treatment decision making and has the potential to be greatly improved by the inclusion of molecular genetics. However, there is a significant knowledge gap in the interpretation of mutational patterns. This study aimed to describe outcomes of allogeneic HCT in patients with CMML in relation to clinical and molecular genetic risk factors. This retrospective study included 64 patients with CMML who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2018, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Next-generation sequencing using targeted myeloid panels was carried out on saved material from 51 patients from the time of transplantation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for analysis of overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence with competing risks and Fine and Gray models were used for analysis of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Mutations were detected in 48 patients (94%), indicating high levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity at transplantation, even among those in complete remission (CR) (n = 14), 86% of whom had detectable mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were ASXL1 (37%), TET2 (37%), RUNX1 (33%), SRSF2 (26%), and NRAS (20%). Risk stratification using the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System molecular score (CPSS-Mol) resulted in 45% of patients moving to a higher risk-group compared with risk stratification using the CPSS. High leucocyte count (>=13 x 109/L), transfusion requirement, and previous intensive chemotherapy were associated with higher incidence of relapse. Being in CR was not linked to better outcomes. Neither ASXL1 nor RUNX1 mutation was associated with a difference in OS, relapse, or NRM, despite being high risk in the nontransplantation setting. TET2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher 3-year OS (73% versus 40%; P = .039). Achieving MRD-negative CR was rare in this CMML cohort, which may explain why we did not observe better outcomes for those in CR. This merits further investigation. Our analyses suggest that the negative impact of ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations can be overcome by allogeneic HCT; however, risk stratification is complex in CMML and requires larger cohorts and multivariate models, presenting an ongoing challenge in this rare disease.Copyright © 2021","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","991.e1-991.e9","","12","27","","Transplant.

Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic value and clinical characteristics of ASXL1 mutations in PMF patients. Eligible studies were systematically searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. We extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS), the number of patients transformed to acute leukemia, and clinical characteristics to carry out a meta-analysis by fixed effect model or random effect model according to the heterogeneity between studies. A total of 4501 PMF patients from 16 cohorts of 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that ASXL1 mutations might predict a shorter OS (HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.79-2.94, P < 0.00001) and a higher probability of transformation to acute leukemia (LFS: HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.30-2.42, P = 0.0003; the rate of acute leukemia transformation: OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.50-2.83, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, ASXL1 mutations were correlated with patients older than 65 years old, male, a lower level of platelet counts, and a higher risk of the international prognostic score system. These findings indicate that ASXL1 mutations have a significant adverse impact on the prognosis of PMF patients and may contribute to risk stratification and prognostic assessment for PMF patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","465-479","","2","100","","Ann.

However, the prognostic implications of various immune cells in patients with MDS remain unclear. We adopted CIBERSORTx to estimate the relative fractions of 22 subtypes of immune cells in the BM of 316 patients with MDS and correlated the results with clinical outcomes. A lower fraction of unpolarized M0 macrophages and higher fractions of M2 macrophages and eosinophils were significantly associated with inferior survival. An immune cell scoring system (ICSS) was constructed based on the proportion of these 3 immune cells in the BM. The ICSS high-risk patients had higher BM blast counts, higher frequencies of poor-risk cytogenetics, and more NPM1, TP53, and WT1 mutations than intermediate- and low-risk patients. The ICSS could stratify patients with MDS into 3 risk groups with distinct leukemia-free survival and overall survival among the total cohort and in the subgroups of patients with lower and higher disease risk based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The prognostic significance of ICSS was also validated in another independent cohort. Multivariable analysis revealed that ICSS independently predicted prognosis, regardless of age, IPSS-R, and mutation status. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between high-risk ICSS and nuclear factor kB signaling, oxidative stress, and leukemic stem cell signature pathways. Further studies investigating the mechanistic insight into the crosstalk between stem cells and immune cells are warranted.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Among the 227 patients who received standard chemotherapy, those with higher KIAA0125 expression had a lower complete remission rate, shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with lower expression. The prognostic significance was validated in both TCGA and GSE12417 cohorts. Subgroup analyses showed that higher KIAA0125 expression also predicted shorter DFS and OS in patients with normal karyotype or non-M3 AML. In multivariable analysis, higher KIAA0125 expression remained an adverse risk factor independent of age, WBC counts, karyotypes, and mutation patterns. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that higher KIAA0125 expression was associated with hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell signatures and ATP-binding cassette transporters, two predisposing factors for chemoresistance.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","487-498","","2","100","","Ann.

We investigated the characteristics and prognostic value of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A deletions in 101 patients with T-ALL. The CDKN2A deletion was present in 23% (23/101) of T-ALL by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The most common type of CDKN2A deletion was homozygous deletion (70%, 16/23). A lower frequency of CDKN2A deletion was found in patients with early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL than in patients with non-ETP-ALL (10.4% vs 34.0%; P =.008). Deletion of CDKN2A was significantly associated with younger age (P =.001), higher white blood cell (WBC) count (P <.001) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P =.002).

We evaluated the prognostic value of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM)-based MRD at the end of induction (EOI-MRD). The present retrospective study included 94 adult patients with T-ALL. MRD was detected by six- to eight-colour FCM. Patients who were EOI-MRD positive had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (87.6% vs. 38.8%, P = 0.0020), and a lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (5.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.0005) and overall survival (OS) (32.7% vs. 69.7%, P < 0.0001) than those who were EOI-MRD negative. Moreover, for patients who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at their first remission, EOI-MRD positivity was predictive of post-transplant relapse (2-year CIR: 68.2% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis showed that EOI-MRD was an independent prognostic factor for CIR [hazard ratio (HR) 2.139, P = 0.046], RFS (HR 2.125, P = 0.048) and OS (HR 2.987, P = 0.017). In conclusion, EOI-MRD based on FCM was an independent prognostic factor for relapse and survival in adult T-ALL.

Here, we evaluated correlations of HMGB1 expression in tumor tissues with pathophysiological characteristics of disease and determined the prognostic value of HMGB1 expression in relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL. HMGB1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 66 cases of relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL, and specimens were classified as high or low HMGB1 expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). High HMGB1 expression was significantly correlated with increased Ki67 levels and progressive lymphoma subtypes. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that high HMGB1 expression was associated with unfavorable PFS (P = 0.006) and poorer OS (P < 0.001). Prognostic factors identified by univariate analysis were prognostic index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma non-specified (PIT) score >= 2, bone marrow involvement, Ki67 >= 70%, and high HMGB1 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high HMGB1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poorer PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 3.593; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.171-11.027; P = 0.025] and OS [HR 7.663; 95% CI 2.367-24.803; P = 0.001]. A proposal prognostic model combining HMGB1 and Ki67 expression showed improved prognostic capacity and may help guide treatment planning. High HMGB1 expression may be a promising prognostic predictor and a potential therapeutic target for relapsed/refractory T/NK-CL. Furthermore, to apply HMGB1 as one of the best bio-maker, an external independent control cohort is needed.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","2293-2302","","9","100","","Ann.

Better identification of patients who are likely to relapse can help to inform clinical decisions. We performed RNA sequencing on pretreatment samples from 268 adults with de novo CN-AML who were younger than 60 years of age and achieved a CR after induction treatment with standard ""713"" chemotherapy. After filtering for genes whose expressions were associated with gene mutations known to impact outcome (ie, CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD]), we identified a 10-gene signature that was strongly predictive of patient relapse (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC], 0.81). The signature consisted of 7 coding genes (GAS6, PSD3, PLCB4, DEXI, JMY, NRP1, C10orf55) and 3 long noncoding RNAs. In multivariable analysis, the 10-gene signature was strongly associated with relapse (P,.001), after adjustment for the FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, and NPM1 mutational status. Validation of the expression signature in an independent patient set from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed the signature's strong predictive value, with AUC 5 0.78.

However, the association between sBCMA levels and prognosis in MGUS and SMM has not been studied. We retrospectively analyzed sBCMA levels in stored samples from 99 MGUS and 184 SMM patients. Baseline sBCMA levels were significantly higher in MGUS and SMM patients progressing to MM during clinical follow up. When stratified according to the median baseline sBCMA level for each cohort, higher levels were associated with a shorter PFS for MGUS (HR 3.44 comparing sBCMA >=77 vs <77 ng/mL [95% CI 2.07-5.73, p < 0.001] and SMM (HR 2.0 comparing sBCMA >=128 vs <128 ng/mL, 95% 1.45-2.76, p < 0.001) patients. The effect of sBCMA on PFS was similar even after adjusting for the baseline MGUS or SMM risk stratification. We evaluated paired serum samples and found that sBCMA increased significantly in MGUS and SMM patients who eventually progressed to MM, whereas among MGUS non-progressors the sBCMA level remained stable. While our results require independent validation, they suggest that sBCMA may be a useful biomarker to identify MGUS and SMM patients at increased risk of progression to MM independent of the established risk models.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","120","","6","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\3DG2WM8A\Visram A. et al. - 2021 - Serum BCMA levels predict outcomes in MGUS and smo.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012915073","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; progression free survival; retrospective study; follow up; multiple myeloma; bone marrow biopsy; immunoglobulin heavy chain/ec [Endogenous Compound]; creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; immunoglobulin A/ec [Endogenous Compound]; disease exacerbation; biological marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]; creatinine blood level; prognosis; *antigen blood level; *B cell maturation antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *monoclonal immunoglobulinemia; *smoldering multiple myeloma; bone atrophy; laboratory test; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; risk assessment; whole body CT; whole body MRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We retrospectively analyzed the impact of Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide (BuCy), Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide-Melphalan (BuCyMel) and Clofarabine-Fludarabine-Busulfan (CloFluBu) in pediatric AML-patients, with similar upfront leukemia treatment (NOPHO-DBHconsortium), receiving an HCT between 2010 and 2015. Outcomes of interest were LFS, relapse, TRM and GvHD. 103 patients were included; 30 received BuCy, 37 BuCyMel, and 36 CloFluBu. The 5-years LFS was 43.3% (SE +/- 9.0) in the BuCy group, 59.2 % (SE +/- 8.1) after BuCyMel, and 66.7 % (SE +/- 7.9) after CloFluBu. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed a trend to lower LFS after BuCy compared to CloFluBu (p = 0.07). BuCy was associated with a higher relapse incidence compared to the other regimens (p = 0.06). Younger age was a predictor for relapse (p = 0.02). A strong correlation between Busulfan Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and lower incidence of aGvHD (p < 0.001) was found. In conclusion, LFS after BuCyMel and CloFluBu was comparable, lower LFS was found after BuCy, due to higher relapse incidence. CloFluBu was associated with lower incidence of aGvHD, suggesting lower toxicity with this type of conditioning. This finding is also explained by the impact of Busulfan monitoring.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","1426-1432","","6","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\WUUZVW8I\Versluys A.B. et al. - 2021 - Hematopoietic cell transplant in pediatric acute m.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010196976","article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; human cell; child; cancer recurrence; incidence; acute graft versus host disease; cancer patient; cyclophosphamide; fludarabine; *relapse; *acute myeloid leukemia; *graft versus host reaction; *hematopoietic cell; busulfan; clofarabine; drug combination; drug monitoring; drug therapy; melphalan; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patient-level data from two pivotal trials, ELIANA (tisagenlecleucel; n 5 79) and MT103-205 (blinatumomab; n 5 70), were used in comparisons of CR and OS, controlling for cross-trial difference in available patient characteristics. Five different adjustment approaches were implemented: stabilized inverse probability of treatment weight (sIPTW); trimmed sIPTW; stratification by propensity score quintiles; adjustment for prognostic factors; and adjustment for both prognostic factors and propensity score. Comparative analyses indicate that treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with a statistically significant higher likelihood of achieving CR and lower hazard of death than treatment with blinatumomab. The tisagenlecleucel group exhibited a higher likelihood of CR than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of adjustment approach (odds ratios: 6.71-9.76). Tisagenlecleucel was also associated with a lower hazard of death than blinatumomab in every analysis, ranging from 68% to 74% lower hazard of death than with blinatumomab, determined using multiple adjustment approaches (hazard ratios: 0.26-0.32).

Hence, we sought to determine whether racial disparities exist in the survival of patients with iNHLs in the US. We included 68 059 adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL, n = 41 943), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, n = 22 485), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM, n = 3631) who were diagnosed in the US between 2000 and 2017. Race was categorized as White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native (API/AI). The primary outcome was relative survival (RS), which was estimated using flexible parametric survival models. The RS estimates varied according to race and disease histology but were consistently lower for racial minorities, including those diagnosed during the most recent 5-year time-period of 2012-2017. On multivariable analysis for RS, Black patients with FL had a 32% higher excess mortality rate compared to White patients [adjusted excess hazard ratio (aEHR), 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51; p <.001], corresponding to a difference of 55 (95% CI, 24-86) excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. For MZL, Black patients had a 40% higher excess mortality rate compared to White patients (aEHR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.66; p <.001), corresponding to a difference of 62 (95% CI, 26-98) excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. No significant racial differences were detected for patients with WM. The greatest disparity was seen for younger Black patients with FL. Our findings highlight the need for interventions to improve the outcomes of Black patients with iNHLs, particularly younger Black patients with FL.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","816-822","","7","96","","Am.

Data are scarce on acute liver dysfunction (ALD), despite HM patients cumulating risk factors. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the prevalence of ALD in critically ill HM patients and its impact on outcome. Data of all patients with HM admitted to the medical ICU between 2008 and 2018 were extracted from electronic medical records. ALD was defined by ALT > 165 U/L, AST > 230 U/L, or total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze hospital mortality. Charts of survivors with ALD were reviewed to assess impact of ALD on subsequent anti-cancer treatment. We included 971 patients (60% male), age 64 (54-72) years, of whom 196 (20%) developed ALD. ALD patients were younger, more frequently had liver cirrhosis or acute leukemia, and had increased severity of illness and vital organ support needs. ALD was associated with hospital mortality in univariate (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.95-5.80, p < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.24, p = 0.03). Hospital mortality was 46% in ALD patients; among 106 survivors, a third of patients requiring therapy received it as previously planned, and half of the patients were alive at 1 year. In summary, in a large population of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies, 20% developed ALD, which was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality and occasionally altered further anti-cancer treatment.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:18","2022-09-06 19:01:18","","229-237","","1","100","","Ann.

We aimed to address optimal treatment for these patients. Method(s): SWOG-1211 is a randomised phase 2 trial comparing eight cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg orally on days 1-14 every 21 days), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days), and dexamethasone (20 mg orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 every 21 days; RVd) induction followed by dose-attenuated RVd maintenance (bortezomib 1 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 15 mg orally on days 1-21; dexamethasone 12 mg orally on days 1, 18, and 15 every 28 days) until disease progression with or without elotuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 for cycles 1-2, on days 1 and 11 for cycles 3-8, and on days 1 and 15 during maintenance). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either RVd or RVd-elotuzumab. High-risk multiple myeloma was defined by one of the following: gene expression profiling high risk (GEPhi), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p) or amp1q21, primary plasma cell leukaemia and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (two times the upper limit of normal or more). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, and all analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis among eligible patients who were evaluable for response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01668719. Finding(s): 100 (RVd n=52, RVd-elotuzumab n=48) patients were enrolled between Oct 27, 2013, and May 15, 2016, across 26 cooperative group institutions in the USA. Median age was 64 years (IQR 57-70, range 36-85). 74 (75%) of 99 had International Staging System stage II or stage III disease, 47 (47%) of 99 had amp1q21, 37 (37%) of 100 had del17p, 11 (11%) of 100 had t(14;16), eight (9%) of 90 were GEPhi, seven (7%) of 100 had primary plasma cell leukaemia, five (5%) of 100 had t(14;20), four (4%) of 100 had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and 17 (17%) had two or more features. With a median follow-up of 53 months (IQR 46-59), no difference in median progression-free survival was observed (RVd 33.64 months [95% CI 19.55-not reached], RVd-elotuzumab 31.47 months [18.56-53.98]; hazard ratio 0.968 [80% CI 0.697-1.344]; one-sided p=0.45]. 37 (71%) of 52 patients in the RVd group and 37 (77%) of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group had grade 3 or worse adverse events. No significant differences in the safety profile were observed, although some notable results included grade 3-5 infections (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, eight [17%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), sensory neuropathy (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, six [13%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), and motor neuropathy (one [2%] of 52 in the RVd group, four [8%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group). There were no treatment-related deaths in the RVd group and one death in the RVd-elotuzumab group for which study treatment was listed as possibly contributing by the investigator. Interpretation(s): In the first randomised study of high-risk multiple myeloma reported to date, the addition of elotuzumab to RVd induction and maintenance did not improve patient outcomes. However, progression-free survival in both study groups exceeded the original statistical assumptions and supports the role for continuous proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drug combination maintenance therapy for this patient population.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of NGS MRD at 2 different time points. We performed targeted NGS of 54 genes in bone marrow cells serially obtained at diagnosis, first complete remission (first time point), and after the first consolidation chemotherapy (second time point) from 335 de novo AML patients. Excluding DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations, which are commonly present in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, MRD could be detected in 46.4% of patients at the first time point (MRD1st), and 28.9% at the second time point (MRD2nd). The patients with detectable NGS MRD at either time point had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse and shorter relapse-free survival and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, MRD1st and MRD2nd were both independent poor prognostic factors. However, the patients with positive MRD1st but negative MRD2nd had a similar good prognosis as those with negative MRD at both time points. The incorporation of multiparameter flow cytometry and NGS MRD revealed that the presence of NGS MRD predicted poorer prognosis among the patients without detectable MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry at the second time point but not the first time point. In conclusion, the presence of NGS MRD, especially after the first consolidation therapy, can help predict the clinical outcome of AML patients.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","2456-2466","","10","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology HiSeq: Illumina [United States]","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\3J36LMAB\Tsai C.-H. et al. - 2021 - Clinical implications of sequential MRD monitoring.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012412553","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; human cell; leukemia remission; adolescent; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; incidence; *cancer chemotherapy; age; leukemia relapse; clinical outcome; flow cytometry; DNMT3A gene; TET2 gene; *acute myeloid leukemia; clinical feature; DNA methyltransferase 3A/ec [Endogenous Compound]; gene; genetic analyzer; gene mutation; prediction; RUNX1 gene; *high throughput sequencing; *minimal residual disease/di [Diagnosis]; *monitoring; ASXL1 gene; bone marrow cell; CEBPA gene; consolidation chemotherapy; HiSeq; transcription factor RUNX1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at 12 months (M12) post-HSCT is predictive of relapse. This phase II study aimed to achieve M12 MRD negativity (MRDneg) using an MRD-driven immune-intervention (Md-PII) algorithm based on serial flow-cytometry blood MRD, involving cyclosporine tapering followed in case of failure by donor lymphocytes infusions. Patients had high-risk CLL according to the 2006 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation consensus, in complete or partial response with lymphadenopathy <5 cm and comorbidity score <=2. Donors were HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated (10/10). Forty-two enrolled patients with either 17p deletion (front-line, n=11; relapse n=16) or other high-risk relapse (n=15) received reduced intensity-conditioning regimen before HSCT and were submitted to Md-PII. M12-MRDneg status was achieved in 27 of 42 patients (64%) versus 6 of 42 (14.2%) before HSCT. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 19-53), 3-year overall survival, non-relapse mortality and cumulative incidence of relapse are 86.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 70.8-94.4), 9.5% (95% CI: 3.7-23.4) and 29.6% (95% CI: 17.3-47.7). Incidence of 2-year limited and extensive chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is 38% (95% CI: 23-53) and 23% (95% CI: 10-36) including two cases post Md-PII. Fifteen patients converted to MRDneg either after cyclosporine A withdrawal (n=12) or after cGvHD (n=3). As a time-dependent variable, MRDneg achievement at any time-point correlates with reduced relapse (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.14 [range, 0.04-0.53], P=0.004) and improvement of both progression free (HR 0.18 [range, 0.06-0.6], P<0.005) and overall (HR 0.18 [range, 0.03-0.98], P=0.047) survival.

While SF3B1 mutations are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, SRSF2P95 mutations are found in different disease categories, including MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify molecular determinants of this phenotypic heterogeneity, we explored molecular and clinical features of a prospective cohort of 279 SRSF2P95-mutated cases selected from a population of 2663 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Median number of somatic mutations per subject was 3. Multivariate regression analysis showed associations between co-mutated genes and clinical phenotype, including JAK2 or MPL with myelofibrosis (OR = 26.9); TET2 with monocytosis (OR = 5.2); RAS-pathway genes with leukocytosis (OR = 5.1); and STAG2, RUNX1, or IDH1/2 with blast phenotype (MDS or AML) (OR = 3.4, 1.9, and 2.1, respectively). Within patients with SRSF2-JAK2 co-mutation, JAK2 dominance was invariably associated with clinical feature of MPN, whereas SRSF2 mutation was dominant in MDS/MPN. Within patients with SRSF2-TET2 co-mutation, clinical expressivity of monocytosis was positively associated with co-mutated clone size. This study provides evidence that co-mutation pattern, clone size, and hierarchy concur to determine clinical phenotype, tracing relevant genotype-phenotype associations across disease entities and giving insight on unaccountable clinical heterogeneity within current WHO classification categories.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","2371-2381","","8","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\GJMRYSI7\Todisco G. et al. - 2021 - Co-mutation pattern, clonal hierarchy, and clone s.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2007642988","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; prospective study; risk factor; *gene mutation; TET2 gene; clinical feature; gene; genetic association; *molecular cloning; *myelodysplastic syndrome; *phenotype; *SRSF2 gene; genotype phenotype correlation; idh1 gene; IDH2 gene; JAK2 gene; leukocytosis; monocytosis; MPL gene; myelofibrosis; RUNX1 gene; somatic mutation; STAG2 gene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data are limited on the incidence and nature of these disorders during intensive therapy. This study's objective was to provide a cross-sectional description of MSK impairments in this population. Procedure: Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (rALL), or undergoing HSCT were systematically assessed for MSK impairments as part of Children's Oncology Group study ACCL0934. Assessments occurred at study entry, at 2 months, and at 12 months and included evaluation for signs or symptoms of MSK impairment and the type, site, and diagnosis. Result(s): Six hundred three patients were included. MSK signs or symptoms were present in 48 (8.0%) children at study entry, 64 (13.5%) children at 2 months, and 40 (11.6%) children at 12 months. Arthralgia and/or gait abnormalities were the most common impairments; the knee was the most common site. Arthritis and tendonitis were both rare. Vincristine neuropathy, MSK impacts from central nervous system pathology, and bone or joint pain from underlying cancer were the most common diagnoses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that having rALL (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.07-3.76, p =.03) or obesity (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.12-3.95, p =.02) were risk factors for MSK impairment at study entry. Conclusion(s): MSK impairments are common in this intensively treated patient population, especially in those with rALL and those who are obese.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","e29053","","8","68","","Pediatr.

We performed additional analyses to identify factors that may have contributed to the favorable PFS with denosumab. Ad hoc analyses were performed for patients intending to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; ASCT intent), not intending to undergo ASCT (ASCT no intent), and intent-to-treat according to age (,70 or $70 years) and baseline renal function (#60 mL/min or .60 mL/min creatinine clearance [CrCl]). Of 1718 patients, 930 (54.1%) were in the ASCT-intent subgroup, and 788 (45.9%) were in the ASCT-no-intent subgroup. In the ASCT-intent subgroup, frontline triplet (median PFS, not estimable vs 35.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.65 [0.47-0.90]; descriptive P 5 .009) or bortezomib-only (median PFS, not estimable vs not estimable; HR [95% CI], 0.61 [0.39-0.95]; descriptive P 5 .029) induction regimens demonstrated the strongest PFS benefit favoring denosumab vs zoledronic acid. In the ASCT-no-intent subgroup, no benefit with denosumab vs zoledronic acid was observed. PFS favored denosumab vs zoledronic acid in patients with CrCl .60 mL/min and in patients,70 years old, but no difference was observed in patients with CrCl #60 mL/min or patients $70 years old. The PFS difference observed with denosumab is one of the notable benefits reported in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and was most pronounced in patients intending to undergo ASCT and those who received proteasome inhibitor (PI)2based triplet regimens.

Age and comorbidities, assessed by the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), have been used to address chemotherapy intensity. In the ibrutinib era, it is still unclear whether age, CIRS, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) retain their predictive role on treatment vulnerability. In this series of 712 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with ibrutinib outside clinical trials, baseline ECOG-PS and neutropenia resulted as the most accurate predictors of treatment feasibility and outcomes. Age did not independently influence survival and ibrutinib tolerance, indicating that not age per se, but age-related conditions, may affect drug management. We confirmed the role of CIRS . 6 as a predictor of a poorer progression- and event-free survival (PFS, EFS). The presence of a severe comorbidity was significantly associated with permanent dose reductions (PDRs), not translating into worse outcomes. As expected, del(17p) and/or TP53mut and previous therapies affected PFS, EFS, and overall survival. No study so far has analyzed the influence of concomitant medications and CYP3A inhibitors with ibrutinib. In our series, these factors had no impact, although CYP3A4 inhibitors use correlated with Cox regression analysis, with an increased risk of PDR. Despite the limitation of its retrospective nature, this large study confirmed the role of ECOG-PS as the most accurate predictor of ibrutinib feasibility and outcomes, and importantly, neutropenia emerged as a relevant tool influencing patients' vulnerability. Although CIRS > 6 retained a significant impact on PFS and EFS, its value should be confirmed by prospective studies.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","5490-5500","","24","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\52ZEQM3S\Tedeschi A. et al. - 2021 - Do age, fitness, and concomitant medications influ.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2016368674","aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; drug dose reduction; *cancer chemotherapy; predictor variable; *aging; comorbidity; event free survival; risk factor; disease severity; *treatment outcome; neutropenia/si [Side Effect]; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *fitness; *ibrutinib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *ibrutinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; *ibrutinib/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; Cumulative Illness Rating Scale; drug safety; drug tolerance; ECOG Performance Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, only a few studies have reported details, including risk factors for PALE; however, further clinical evidence of PALE, especially in cerebrospinal fluid human herpesvirus 6-negative cases, is warranted. In addition, data are sparse regarding the risk factors for calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced encephalopathy (CNIE) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in adults. Therefore, we examined the risk factors for and clinical details of PALE and CNIE. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT between January 2005 and November 2017. A total of 485 patients age 46 years (median) were eligible. In total, 14 PALE cases and 11 CNIE cases were identified. Multivariable analyses identified older age, use of an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (URD), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with CNI and mycophenolate mofetil, and grade II-IV acute GVHD as significantly associated with an increased risk of PALE. In 13 patients who received high-dose methylprednisolone (mPSL) therapy, 6 (46%) responded to mPSL therapy, and 3 (23%) achieved complete remission at day 90 after mPSL administration. Furthermore, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), HLA-mismatched URD, and grade II-IV acute GVHD were significantly associated with an increased risk of CNIE. The 5-year nonrelapse mortality rate was 50% in PALE and 63% in CNIE, suggesting a very poor prognosis. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that HLA-mismatched URD and acute GVHD may independently contribute to the development of PALE, possibly in part through HLA-mismatch-derived alloimmune responses.

This protocol featured prephase dexamethasone treatment before conventional remission induction and subsequent risk-directed therapy, including 16 to 22 triple intrathecal treatments, without prophylactic cranial irradiation. The 5-year event-free survival was 80.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.9-81.7), and overall survival 91.1% (95% CI, 90.1-92.1). The cumulative risk of isolated CNS relapse was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.5-2.3), and any CNS relapse 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2-3.2). The isolated CNS relapse rate was significantly lower in patients with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) than in those with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0 vs 4.6%; 95% CI, 2.9-6.3; P < .001). Independent risk factors for isolated CNS relapse included male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0; P = .03), the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0-7.3; P < .001) in B-ALL, and presenting leukocyte count >=50x109/L (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.5-12.2; P = .007) in T-ALL. Significantly lower isolated CNS relapse was associated with the use of total intravenous anesthesia during intrathecal therapy (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.04-0.7; P = .02) and flow cytometry examination of diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.6; P = .006) among patients with B-ALL. Prephase dexamethasone treatment, delayed intrathecal therapy, use of total intravenous anesthesia during intrathecal therapy, and flow cytometry examination of diagnostic CSF may improve CNS control in childhood ALL.

Two potential factors include minimal residual disease (MRD) and CD3+ donor-specific chimerism. We retrospectively examined 93 consecutive patients who received upfront or deferred tandem auto-alloHSCT. Bone marrow (Euroflow) MRD was assessed pre-alloHSCT and 3-monthly post-alloHSCT. CD3+ donor chimerism was assessed at D30, D60, D90, 6 m and 12 m post-alloHSCT. There was no statistical difference between upfront and deferred transplants in progression free survival (PFS) (34 m vs. 15 m respectively, p = 0.20) and overall survival (OS) (75.5 m vs. 62.7 m respectively, p = 0.56). Patients who were MRD-positive post-alloHSCT had inferior PFS to MRD-negative patients from 6 m (6 m HR 3.32, p = 0.02; 9 m HR 4.08, p = 0.003; 12 m HR 4.47, p = 0.008). Attainment or maintenance of MRD-negativity predicted reduced relapse risk (23.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference in OS between the MRD-negative and positive groups. Full CD3+ donor chimerism at early time points (D30 and D90) was associated with increased risk of acute GVHD (D30 p < 0.001, D90 p = 0.006) and extensive chronic GVHD (D90 p = 0.04), but not PFS or OS. These data support the use of sequential MRD evaluation post-alloHSCT to inform intervention to eradicate persistent or emergent MRD-positive disease.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","1116-1125","","5","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature EuroFlow","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\BUUPWU2R\Tan J.L.C. et al. - 2021 - Evaluation of EuroFlow minimal residual disease me.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2007476680","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; *multiple myeloma/th [Therapy]; adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; cancer recurrence; graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; priority journal; risk factor; *minimal residual disease; *hematology analyzer; *patient monitoring; EuroFlow; prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intensive chemotherapy often induces gastrointestinal adverse events. These adverse events leave patients in a state of malnutrition, leading to a reduction in body weight. In this study, we analyzed the impact of body weight loss before allo-HCT on survival outcomes of acute leukemia patients (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia and mixed phenotype acute leukemia). A loss of body weight (LBW), which was a reduction of body weight from diagnosis or relapse to transplantation, was calculated in 182 acute leukemia patients who received first allo-HCT at our center between June 2006 and September 2019. A receiver operating characteristics curve for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was plotted for defining the cut-off value of LBW. The cutoff value of LBW was defined as 13.2%. A higher LBW was significantly associated with inferior NRM and overall survival (OS) (2-year [2y] NRM 36.1% versus 11.5%, P = .0025; 2y-OS 39.9% versus 65.8%, P = .020). The adverse impact of LBW was also confirmed in multivariate analyses for NRM and OS (HR of NRM 2.74 [1.25-6.03], P = .0012; HR of OS 2.06 [1.00-3.07], P = .0049). The main cause of death included disease progression (n = 34) and infection (n = 35). Death cause by infection was more frequently observed in the high-LBW group (15 cases [35.7%] versus 20 cases [14.3%]; P = .0035). In addition, subgroup analyses based on a combination of the body mass index at diagnosis and LBW were performed. When the non-overweight-low LBW group (body mass index [BMI] <=25 and LBW <=13.2%) was used as a reference in multivariate analysis, the overweight-high LBW group (BMI >25 and LBW >13.2%) showed an increased risk of poor survival outcomes (HR of NRM 4.27 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.82-10.0], P < .001; HR of OS 1.93 [95%, CI 1.00-3.71], P = .050). High LBW was significantly associated with inferior survival outcomes, and the adverse effect of malnutrition might be greater than the favorable effect of the reduction in overweight.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:19","2022-09-06 19:01:19","","340.e1-340.e6","","4","27","","Transplant.

Recent large-scale retrospective studies reported that CMV reactivation is an independent risk factor for poor post-transplant outcomes, although the development of CMV end-organ disease is suppressed by the CMV antiviral preemptive therapy, which has been mainly analyzed for hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute leukemia. However, it remains unclear whether CMV reactivation also has a negative effect on post-transplant outcomes in aplastic anemia (AA). Therefore, we evaluated the clinical relevance of CMV reactivation in patients with AA using the registry database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Adult patients with AA who underwent their first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2017 and who survived with neutrophil engraftment until 100 days post-transplantation were analyzed (n = 672). Patients were monitored using pp65 antigenemia since the time of engraftment, and CMV reactivation in the analysis of this study was defined as the beginning of CMV preemptive or definitive therapy within 100 days post-transplantation. CMV reactivation occurred in 372 (55%) patients, including 19 with CMV end-organ disease. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, patients aged >=40 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .003) who underwent transplantation from HLA-matched related peripheral blood stem cells (HR, 2.85; P = .008), HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow (BM) (HR, 2.01; P = .036), and other stem cell sources (HR, 2.32; P = .007) compared to HLA-matched related BM, CMV reactivation (HR 1.65; P = .042), grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR 1.73; P = .013), and secondary graft failure (HR 7.09; P < .001) had independent risk factors that significantly decreased overall survival, indicating that CMV reactivation, one of the early events at post-transplantation, had a significant negative impact on the long-term prognosis at post-transplantation. This effect was more pronounced in patients aged >=40 years who received a graft from other than HLA-matched related BM. Comparing the causes of death with and without CMV reactivation, no significant difference in the frequency of each cause of death was observed between the 2 groups (P = .453). Improvement of post-transplant CMV management that effectively suppresses CMV reactivation in the early stage at post-transplantation will be required to improve post-transplant outcomes, especially in high-risk patients.

In this study, this hypothesis was evaluated retrospectively for previously treated MM patients in Kansai Myeloma Forum database who received lenalidomide (LEN) with or without dexamethasone for the first time. Disease stability index (DSI) was defined as (maximum - minimum values of M protein during the 90 days before the start of LEN) divided by M-protein values at the start of LEN. The patients were classified into three groups: stable (S), DSI <= 0.25; increasing (I), DSI > 0.25 with increasing M protein; decreasing (D), DSI > 0.25 with decreasing M protein. In univariate analysis of 352 patients, DSI group ""I"", non-IgG type, serum albumin<3.5 g/dL, and age>=70 were statistically significant prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the former 3 risk factors were statistically significant for poor overall survival.

However, no universal prognostic factors have been identified to date. To clarify a subgroup with high risk of relapse, the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) was explored in the AML-D11 trial by the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. MRD was prospectively evaluated at after induction therapy and at the end of all chemotherapy, using flow cytometry (FCM-MRD) and GATA1-targeted deep sequencing (GATA1-MRD). A total of 78 patients were eligible and 76 patients were stratified to the standard risk (SR) group by morphology. In SR patients, FCM-MRD and GATA1-MRD after induction were positive in 5/65 and 7/59 patients, respectively. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 95.0% and 96.7% in the FCM-MRD-negative population, and 60.0% and 80.0% in the positive population. Three-year EFS and OS rates were both 98.1% in the GATA1-MRD-negative population, and 57.1% and 71.4% in the positive population.

The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to clarify the clinical significance of PCI before HCT in patients with non-remission ALL. Patients with non-remission ALL who received HCT between 2005 and 2015 at 16 institutions were included. PCI was objectively defined and classified to three groups according to the intensity of PCI (no, intensive, or moderate). The study cohort consisted of 104 patients with a median age of 38 (range 17-68). A significant decrease of blast percentage in the peripheral blood (PB) was confirmed in both PCI groups, suggesting that PCIs were effective to stabilize the disease activity. The group with moderate PCI had higher nucleated cell count in the BM compared to the group with intensive PCI or the group without PCI. The overall survival (OS) rates of groups with intensive and no PCI showed comparable and significantly better compared to the group with moderate PCI (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the OS of moderate PCI group was significantly worse compared to that of intensive PCI group (HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.32-4.14, P = 0.004), while the OS of intensive PCI group was comparable to that of the group without PCI. These results suggest that the intensity of PCI rather than the response to PCI may contribute to improve the transplant outcome in patients with ALL not in remission.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","2763-2771","","11","100","","Ann.

The study cohort consisted of 519 patients classified according to the intensity (intensive/moderate) of PCI and their response to PCI. The group treated with PCI had higher blast counts in the peripheral blood (PB) and had a lower overall survival (OS) rate (P < .001) and higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate (P = .035) compared with those without PCI (no PCI group). Approximately 40% of the patients (68 of 236) achieved a good response to PCI (good PCI group), and those patients had lower blast counts in the PB compared with the group with poor response to PCI (poor PCI group). OS in the good PCI group was comparable to that in the no PCI group and significantly better than that in the poor PCI group (hazard ratio, .54; 95% confidence interval, .39 to .77; P < .001). However, OS was significantly lower in patients with intensive/moderate PCI compared with the no PCI group. These results suggest that PCI increases NRM without decreasing the post-transplantation relapse rate, but may be beneficial for patients with lower blast counts in PB irrespective of its intensity.

Further, in 29 patients, the skin rash appeared at an early stage (within 1 week) after treatment initiation. Univariate analysis revealed that the risk of skin rash significantly increased in patients with advanced age (p = 0.017), myeloma subtype (p = 0.014), no prior chemotherapy (p = 0.012), and Len dosage (p = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that advanced age (>= 70 years), BJP-subtype of myeloma and no prior chemotherapy were significant risk factors for the skin rash associated with Len.

The association of MGUS and chronic RDs is well established, but the impact of RDs on the risk of transformation into overt multiple myeloma (MM) has not been evaluated so far. MGUS patients diagnosed between January 2000 and August 2016 were identified and screened for concomitant RDs. RDs were grouped into antibody (Ab)-mediated RDs and non-Ab-mediated RDs (polymyalgia rheumatica, large-vessel giant cell arteritis, spondyloarthritis, and gout). Progression to MM was defined as a categorical (yes/no) or continuous time-dependent (time to progression) variable. Of 2935 MGUS patients, 255 (9%) had a concomitant RD. MGUS patients diagnosed with non-Ab-mediated RDs had a doubled risk of progression compared with those without a concomitant RD (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9; P 5.02). These data translate into a 5-year risk of progression of 4% in MGUS patients without rheumatologic comorbidity, 10% in those with concomitant non-Ab-mediated RDS, and 2% in those with Ab-mediated RDs. By using the complex risk stratification model that includes myeloma protein (M-protein) concentration, immunoglobulin type, and level of free light chain ratio as variables, patients with non-Ab-mediated RDs (n 5 57) had the highest risk for progression (hazard ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.5-30.7; P 5.01) compared with patients with Ab-mediated RDs (n 5 77). Chronic inflammatory diseases have an impact on the risk of MGUS progressing into overt MM, with a doubled risk of transformation observed in patients with non-Ab-mediated RDs. Future research can elucidate whether comorbidities such as RDs should be included in currently applied prognostic MGUS scores.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","1746-1754","","6","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\6Z9FPPS3\Steiner N. et al. - 2021 - Rheumatologic diseases impact the risk of progress.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011480275","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; immunosuppressive treatment; follow up; comorbidity; clinical outcome; disease association; risk factor; prevalence; *monoclonal immunoglobulinemia/di [Diagnosis]; *multiple myeloma; *rheumatic disease; AL amyloidosis; chronic disease; disease exacerbation; giant cell arteritis; gout; M protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; prognostic assessment; rheumatic polymyalgia; spondylarthritis; survival analysis; Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the relevance for leukemogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target, the prognostic role is controversial. To investigate the prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations, we analyzed 1529 adult AML patients using next-generation sequencing. PTPN11 mutations were detected in 106 of 1529 (6.93%) patients (median VAF: 24%) in dominant (36%) and subclonal (64%) configuration. Patients with PTPN11 mutations were associated with concomitant mutations in NPM1 (63%), DNMT3A (37%), and NRAS (21%) and had a higher rate of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable cytogenetics (57.8% vs 39.1%; P < .001) and higher white blood cell counts (P = .007) compared with PTPN11 wild-type patients. In a multivariable analysis, PTPN11 mutations were independently associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; P < .001), relapse-free survival (HR: 1.52; P = .013), and a lower rate of complete remission (odds ratio: 0.46; P = .008). Importantly, the deleterious effect of PTPN11 mutations was confined predominantly to the ELN favorable-risk group and patients with subclonal PTPN11 mutations (HR: 2.28; P < .001) but not found with dominant PTPN11 mutations (HR: 1.07; P = .775), presumably because of significant differences within the rate and spectrum of associated comutations. In conclusion, our data suggest an overall poor prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations in AML, which is significantly modified by the underlying cytogenetics and the clonal context in which they occur.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","3279-3289","","17","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology MiSeq: Illumina, NextSeq","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\FV6BYHLC\Stasik S. et al. - 2021 - Impact of PTPN11 mutations on clinical outcome ana.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2014533354","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; human cell; leukemia remission; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; *clinical outcome; cancer patient; prevalence; cytogenetics; *gene mutation; DNMT3A gene; high throughput sequencing; *acute myeloid leukemia; *PTPN11 gene; clinical feature; DNA methyltransferase 3A/ec [Endogenous Compound]; gene; genetic analyzer; genetic association; high throughput sequencer; leukocyte count; NPM1 gene; NRAS gene; nucleophosmin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; survival time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-risk CGAs included del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and gain 1q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and del(13) by conventional cytogenetics. Thirty-two percent had a trisomy, 27% had a high-risk CGA, and 11% had both. Among patients with any trisomy, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 90%, respectively, compared to 25% and 65%, respectively, for patients with any high-risk CGA. Patients with co-existent trisomy and high-risk CGAs had 3-year PFS and OS of 43% and 89%, respectively, whereas those with isolated high-risk CGAs without trisomy had 3-year PFS and OS of 13% and 49%, respectively. The PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.3; P =.02) and OS (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 13; P =.006) were worse for high-risk CGAs without versus those with concurrent trisomies. Our findings suggest a protective impact of trisomies in patients with high-risk CGAs and a potential need for revised risk stratification assessments to account for overlapping genetic abnormalities.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","243.e1-243.e6","","3","27","","Transplant.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), their incidence and prognostic implications remain poorly reported. Our targeted next-generation sequencing approach allowed comprehensive assessment of genotype across the entire IDH1 and IDH2 locus in 1085 consecutive unselected and newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL and identified 4% of, virtually exclusive (47 of 49 patients), IDH1/2Mut. Mutational patterns of IDH1/2Mut in T-ALL present some specific features compared to AML. Whereas IDH2R140Q mutation was frequent in T-ALL (25 of 51 mutations), the IDH2R172 AML hotspot was absent. IDH2 mutations were associated with older age, an immature phenotype, more frequent RAS gain-of-function mutations and epigenetic regulator loss-of-function alterations (DNMT3A and TET2). IDH2 mutations, contrary to IDH1 mutations, appeared to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis with the NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN classifier. IDH2Mut were significantly associated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse and very dismal outcome, suggesting that IDH2-mutated T-ALL cases should be identified at diagnosis in order to benefit from therapeutic intensification and/or specific IDH2 inhibitors.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","74","","1","14","","J.

We investigated the role of MRD in refining complete remission (CR) and treatment duration in the phase 3 FLUGAZA clinical trial, which randomized 283 elderly AML patients to induction and consolidation with fludarabine plus cytarabine (FLUGA) vs 5-azacitidine. After consolidation, patients continued treatment if MRD was $0.01% or stopped if MRD was,0.01%, as assessed by multidimensional flow cytometry (MFC). On multivariate analysis including genetic risk and treatment arm, MRD status in patients achieving CR (N 5 72) was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR, 3.45; P 5 .002). Achieving undetectable MRD significantly improved RFS of patients with adverse genetics (HR, 0.32; P 5 .013). Longer overall survival was observed in patients with undetectable MRD after induction though not after consolidation. Although leukemic cells from most patients displayed phenotypic aberrancies vs their normal counterpart (N 5 259 of 265), CD34 progenitors from cases with undetectable MRD by MFC carried extensive genetic abnormalities identified by whole-exome sequencing. Interestingly, the number of genetic alterations significantly increased from diagnosis to MRD stages in patients treated with FLUGA vs 5-azacitidine (2.2-fold vs 1.1-fold; P 5 .001). This study supports MRD assessment to refine CR after semi-intensive therapy or hypomethylating agents, but unveils that improved sensitivity is warranted to individualize treatment and prolong survival of elderly AML patients achieving undetectable MRD.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:20","2022-09-06 19:01:20","","760-770","","3","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\ENLF3IAU\Simoes C. et al. - 2021 - Measurable residual disease in elderly acute myelo.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011201479","aged; article; controlled study; human; major clinical study; overall survival; recurrence free survival; leukemia remission; cancer prognosis; multivariate analysis; treatment duration; cancer patient; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; genetic risk; *fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *azacitidine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *azacitidine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *azacitidine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *azacitidine/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]; *cancer therapy; *cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; *cytarabine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cytarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *cytarabine/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]; *fludarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; *fludarabine/cm [Drug Comparison]; *fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *fludarabine/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; *fludarabine/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *minimal residual disease; cancer staging; flow cytometry; low drug dose; multiple cycle treatment; phenotype; whole exome sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to develop a contemporary disease-risk stratification system (DRSS) that accounts for heterogeneous transplantation indications. Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study we included 55 histology and remission status combinations across haematological malignancies, including acute leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders. A total of 47 265 adult patients (aged >=18 years) who received an allogeneic HSCT between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2016, and were reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry were included. We divided EBMT patients into derivation (n=25 534), tuning (n=18 365), and geographical validation (n=3366) cohorts. Disease combinations were ranked in a multivariable Cox regression for overall survival in the derivation cohort, cutoff for risk groups were evaluated for the tuning cohort, and the selected system was tested on the geographical validation cohort. An independent single-centre US cohort of 660 patients transplanted between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2015 was used to externally validate the results. Finding(s): The DRSS model stratified patients in the derivation cohort (median follow-up was 2.1 years [IQR 1.0-3.2]) into five risk groups with increasing mortality risk: low risk (reference group), intermediate-1 (hazard ratio for overall survival 1.26 [95% CI 1.17-1.36], p<0.0001), intermediate-2 (1.53 [1.42-1.66], p<0.0001), high (2.03 [1.86-2.22], p<0.0001), and very high (2.87 [2.63-3.13], p<0.0001). DRSS levels were also associated with a stepwise increase in risk across the tuning and geographical validation cohort. In the external validation cohort (median follow-up was 5.7 years [IQR 4.5-7.1]), the DRSS scheme separated patients into 4 risk groups associated with increasing risk of mortality: intermediate-2 risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34 [95% CI 1.04-1.74], p=0.025), high risk (HR 2.03 [95% CI 1.39-2.95], p=0.00023) and very-high risk (HR 2.26 [95% CI 1.62-3.15], p<0.0001) patients compared with the low risk and intermediate-1 risk group (reference group). Across all cohorts, between 64% and 65% of patients were categorised as having intermediate-risk disease by a previous prognostic system (ie, the disease-risk index [DRI]). The DRSS reclassified these intermediate-risk DRI patients, with 855 (6%) low risk, 7111 (51%) intermediate-1 risk, 5700 (41%) intermediate-2 risk, and 375 (3%) high risk or very high risk of 14 041 patients in a subanalysis combining the tuning and internal geographic validation cohorts. The DRI projected 2-year overall survival was 62.1% (95% CI 61.2-62.9) for these 14 041 patients, while the DRSS reclassified them into finer prognostic groups with overall survival ranging from 45.7% (37.4-54.0; very high risk patients) to 73.1% (70.1-76.2; low risk patients). Interpretation(s): The DRSS is a novel risk stratification tool including disease features related to histology, genetic profile, and treatment response. The model should serve as a benchmark for future studies. This system facilitates the interpretation and analysis of studies with heterogeneous cohorts, promoting trial-design with more inclusive populations.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is usually associated with lower non-relapse mortality (NRM), higher relapse rate and similar overall-survival (OS) as myeloablative-conditioning (MAC). Fludarabine/treosulfan (FT) is a reduced-toxicity regimen with intense anti-leukaemia activity and a favourable toxicity profile. We investigated post-transplant outcomes in 1722 MDS patients following allo-HCT with FT (n = 367), RIC (n = 687) or MAC (n = 668). FT and RIC recipients were older than MAC recipients, median age 59, 59 and 51 years, respectively (P < 0.001) but other disease characteristics were similar. The median follow-up was 64 months (1-171). Five-year relapse rates were 25% (21-30), 38% (34-42) and 25% (22-29), after FT, RIC and MAC, respectively, (P < 0.001). NRM was 30% (25-35), 27% (23-30) and 34% (31-38, P = 0.008), respectively. Five-year OS was 50% (44-55), 43% (38-47), and 43% (39-47), respectively (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, FT was associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.55, P < 0.001) and better OS (HR 0.72, P = 0.01). MAC was associated with higher NRM (HR 1.44, P = 0.001). In conclusion, FT is associated with similar low relapse rates as MAC and similar low NRM as RIC, resulting in improved OS.

Sixty-eight percent of the 401 patients underwent HCT using a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen, but there were no statistically significant differences in the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), or cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality based on the conditioning intensity. Among the recipients of MAC regimens, 38.4% of deaths were from treatment-related causes, especially acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and end-organ failure, as compared to only 20.9% of deaths in the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) cohort. Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) during conditioning and experiencing grade III/IV acute GVHD was associated with worse OS. In addition, a diagnosis of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and having a structurally complex karyotype at tMN diagnosis were associated with worse EFS.

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. Method(s): In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. Finding(s): 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 2.53, 95% CI 1.16-5.52; p=0.020); male sex (3.53; 1.44-8.67; p=0.006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (2.67, 1.33-5.36; p=0.005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (2.41, [1.08-5.38]; p=0.033) in autologous HSCT recipients. Interpretation(s): Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

We describe our institutional experience with 221 pediatric patients who experienced disease relapse after their first alloHCT for acute leukemias or MDS between 1990 and 2018. In a multivariable model, being in first complete remission at first alloHCT, longer duration of remission after alloHCT, experiencing GVHD and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a second alloHCT after post-transplant relapse. Of these variables, only longer interval from alloHCT to relapse, receiving a second alloHCT or DLI, and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were associated with improved overall survival. Our data support pursuing second alloHCT for patients who have experienced relapse after their first transplant, as that remains the only salvage modality with a reasonable chance of inducing long-term remission.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","1866-1875","","8","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\2YMABTXT\Sharma A. et al. - 2021 - Outcomes of pediatric patients who relapse after f.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010853570","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cyclosporine/cb [Drug Combination]; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; major clinical study; male; mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; overall survival; retrospective study; tacrolimus/cb [Drug Combination]; tacrolimus/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; human cell; leukemia remission; thymocyte antibody/dt [Drug Therapy]; thymocyte antibody/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; child; cancer survival; busulfan/dt [Drug Therapy]; busulfan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy]; melphalan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; myeloablative conditioning; thiotepa/dt [Drug Therapy]; thiotepa/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; whole body radiation; busulfan/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; reduced intensity conditioning; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *leukemia relapse; *myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; busulfan/cb [Drug Combination]; cancer patient; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; *pediatric patient; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy]; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *acute myeloid leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy]; *cancer recurrence; *myelodysplastic syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]; *myelodysplastic syndrome/rt [Radiotherapy]; *outcome assessment; cancer regression; donor lymphocyte infusion; school child; tacrolimus/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; time to treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While patients with longer remission after initial alloSCT are recommended to receive cell therapy (CT) such as 2ndalloSCT or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), survival for patients who relapse within 6 months of alloSCT has been dismal. We evaluated the outcomes of AML relapse after alloSCT to assess the impact of different treatments on long-term survival. One hundred and seventy-two patients with AML underwent alloSCT at the Penn State Cancer Institute from January 2014 to August 2019. Sixty-nine patients relapsed (median age, 60 years; range, 10-75). Of these, 4 patients underwent 2ndalloSCT, and 26 received DLI. One-year overall survival (OS) in all cases was 20.3% (95% CI: 11.8-30.4%). Patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 at relapse showed a better 1-year OS than those with PS 3-4. Median OS for patients who received chemotherapy only or chemotherapy with CT was 74 or 173.5 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Relapsed patients receiving conventional re-induction chemotherapy were categorized as the high-intensity chemotherapy (H) group, while those receiving treatments such as hypomethylating agents or targeted agents were categorized as the low-intensity chemotherapy (L) group. The H group showed a better 1-year OS compared with the L group. Patients who received H + CT showed a better 1-year OS of 52.9% than the other 3 groups (p < 0.001). Even for patients with post-alloSCT remission duration of less than 6 months, the statistical significance was preserved. Factors including age, donor source at 1stalloSCT, time to relapse, blast counts, PS at relapse, and treatment type after post-alloSCT relapse were used for a multivariate analysis, and matched or mismatched related donor and H + CT after alloSCT were identified as independent factors associated with OS. These findings support the use of H + CT as the treatment option of choice for AML patients who relapse after alloSCT when feasible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","2585-2592","","10","100","","Ann.

We prospectively evaluated a weighted donor ranking algorithm designed to prioritize HLA-compatible unrelated donors (URDs) with weak inhibitory KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 interaction, followed by donors with nontolerized activating KIR2DS1, and finally those with KIR centromeric B haplotype. During donor evaluation, we performed KIR genotyping and ranked 2079 URDs for 527 subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Among all patients, 394 (75%) had at least 1 KIR-advantageous donor, and 263 (50%) underwent HCT. In patients with AML, KIR3DL1 weak inhibition provided protection from relapse. Compared with KIR3DL1-Weak Inhibiting donors, KIR3DL1-Noninteracting donors were associated with increased risk of relapse (HR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.33-6.64; P = .008) and inferior event-free survival (EFS; HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .015). KIR3DL1-Strong Inhibiting donors were associated with HR, 1.65 (95% CI, 0.66-4.08; P = .25) for AML relapse and HR, 1.6 (95% CI, 0.81-3.17; P = .1) for EFS when compared with the use of KIR3DL1-weak inhibiting donors. Donor KIR2DS1/HLA-C1 status and centromeric KIR haplotype-B content were not associated with decreased risk of AML relapse. There was no benefit to KIR-based donor selection in patients with MDS. This study demonstrates that donor KIR typing is feasible, and prioritization of donors with certain KIR3DL1 genotypes may confer a protection from relapse after HCT in patients with AML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","2003-2011","","7","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\24T9NPD3\Shaffer B.C. et al. - 2021 - Prospective KIR genotype evaluation of hematopoiet.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011906523","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; human; major clinical study; overall survival; acute graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; human cell; prospective study; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer recurrence; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; priority journal; cancer incidence; event free survival; *donor; *gene; *genetic analysis; *genotype; *KIR gene; *therapy effect; algorithm; allele; classification; clinical outcome; disease association; donor ranking system; feasibility study; gene expression; haplotype; HLA A antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; HLA antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; HLA B antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; HLA C antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; HLA gene; homozygosity; killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor 3DL1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; patient selection; protein protein interaction; risk factor; unrelated donor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is used for prophylactic T-cell depletion and GVHD prevention, but there are no clear guidelines for the optimal dosing of ATG. It is suspected that for patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), current weight-based dosing of ATG can be excessive, which can result in profound T-cell depletion and poor transplant outcome. Method(s): The objective of the study is to evaluate the association of low preconditioning ALC with outcomes in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) alloSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and ATG. We conducted a single-center retrospective longitudinal cohort study of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients over 18 years old undergoing alloSCT. In total, 64 patients were included and dichotomized into lower ALC and higher ALC groups with the cutoff of 500/mul on D-7. Result(s): Patients with preconditioning ALC <500/mul were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and higher infectious mortality. The incidence of acute GVHD and moderate-severe chronic GVHD as well as relapse rates did not differ according to preconditioning ALC. In multivariate analyses, low preconditioning ALC was recognized as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS. Conclusion(s): Patients with lower ALC are exposed to excessive dose of ATG, leading to profound T-cell depletion that results in higher infectious mortality and shorter OS. Our results call for the implementation of more creative dosing regimens for patients with low preconditioning ALC.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","","","(Seo, Shin, Koh, Kim, Yoon) Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea","12","","Ther.

Scott et al","Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","","2666-6367","10.1016/j.jtct.2021.02.031","https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transplantation-and-cellular-therapy","Several prospective randomized trials comparing conditioning intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have been performed, with conflicting results. Although reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) leads to lower treatment-related mortality (TRM), this is offset by higher rates of relapse. Long-term follow-up of randomized comparative trials are limited. Here we present long-term follow-up of a randomized comparison of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) compared with RIC before HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS). Long-term comparative analyses of overall survival, relapse, and relapse-free survival were performed. Patients age 18 to 65 years with <5% marrow myeloblasts were randomized to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137), followed by HCT from an HLA-matched donor. The primary endpoint of the trial was an 18-month pointwise comparison of overall survival. The analyses were performed using a proportional hazards model. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 51 months. At 4 years, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 25.1% for MAC, compared with 9.9% for RIC (P < .001). Patients who received RIC had a significantly higher risk of relapse compared to those who received MAC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.06; 95% CI, 2.59 to 6.35; P < 0.001). Among the patients who relapsed after HCT, postrelapse survival was similar at 3 years (24% for MAC and 26% for RIC). Overall survival was superior for patients who received MAC compared to those who received RIC (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.2; P = .03). Our data show that patients who received MAC were at higher risk of late TRM compared with those who received RIC; however, because of the exceedingly high rates of relapse in the RIC arm, overall survival remained significantly better for patients who received MAC. Among patients with MDS or AML eligible for either MAC or RIC regimens, long-term follow up demonstrates a survival advantage for patients who received MAC.Copyright © 2021","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","483.e1-483.e6","","6","27","","Transplant.

Here, we have developed the LEukemia Artificial intelligence Program (LEAP) with the extreme gradient boosting decision tree method for the optimal treatment recommendation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). A cohort of CML-CP patients was randomly divided into training/validation (N = 504) and test cohorts (N = 126). The training/validation cohort was used for 3-fold cross validation to develop the LEAP CML-CP model using 101 variables at diagnosis. The test cohort was then applied to the LEAP CML-CP model and an optimum TKI treatment was suggested for each patient. The area under the curve in the test cohort was 0.81899.Backward multivariate analysis identified age at diagnosis, the degree of comorbidities, and TKI recommended therapy by the LEAP CML-CP model as independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The bootstrapping method internally validated the association of the LEAP CML-CP recommendation with overall survival as an independent prognostic for overall survival. Selecting treatment according to the LEAP CML-CP personalized recommendations, in this model, is associated with better survival probability compared to treatment with a LEAP CML-CP non-recommended therapy. This approach may pave a way of new era of personalized treatment recommendations for patients with cancer.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","241-250","","2","96","","Am.

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of adult patients with ALL in CR1 that had received HCT with PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis from HLA-matched sibling (MSD) (n = 78), matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 94) and haploidentical family (Haplo) (n = 297) donors registered in the EBMT database between 2010 and 2018. The median follow-up period of the entire cohort was 2.2 years. Result(s): Median age of patients was 38 years (range 18-76). Compared to MSD and MUD, Haplo patients received peripheral blood less frequently. For Haplo, MUD, and MSD, the cumulative incidence of 100-day acute GVHD grade II-IV and III-IV, and 2-year chronic and extensive chronic GVHD were 32%, 41%, and 34% (p = 0.4); 13%, 15%, and 15% (p = 0.8); 35%, 50%, and 42% (p = 0.01); and 11%, 17%, and 21% (p = 0.2), respectively. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality was 20%, 20%, and 28% (p = 0.8); and 21%, 18%, and 21% (p = 0.8) for Haplo, MUD, and MSD, respectively. The leukemia-free survival, overall survival and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival for Haplo, MUD, and MSD was 59%, 62%, and 51% (p = 0.8); 66%, 69%, and 62% (p = 0.8); and 46%, 44%, and 35% (p = 0.9), respectively. On multivariable analysis, transplant outcomes did not differ significantly between donor types. TBI-based conditioning was associated with better LFS. Conclusion(s): Donor type did not significantly affect transplant outcome in patient with ALL receiving SCT with PTCy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","84","","1","14","","J.

Signal regulatory protein a (SIRPalpha) is an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor that is expressed on myeloid cells; the interaction between SIRPalpha and its ubiquitously expressed ligand CD47 elicits an inhibitory signal that suppresses macrophage phagocytic function. Additional studies showed that donor-recipient mismatch in SIRPalpha variants might activate monocytic allorecognition, possibly as the result of non-self SIRPalpha-CD47 interaction. However, the frequency of SIRPalpha variation and its role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unexplored. We studied 350 patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent HLA-matched related HSCT and found that SIRPalpha allelic mismatches were present in 39% of transplantation pairs. SIRPalpha variant mismatch was associated with a significantly higher rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; P = .03), especially de novo chronic GVHD (HR, 2.0; P = .01), after adjusting for other predictors. Those with mismatched SIRPalpha had a lower relapse rate (HR, 0.6; P = .05) and significantly longer relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.6; P = .04). Notably, the effect of SIRPalpha variant mismatch on relapse protection was most pronounced early after HSCT and in patients who were not in remission at HSCT (cumulative incidence, 73% vs 54%; HR, 0.5; P = .01). These findings show that SIRPalpha variant mismatch is associated with HSCT outcomes, possibly owing to innate allorecognition. SIRPalpha variant matching could provide valuable information for donor selection and risk stratification in HSCT.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","3407-3417","","17","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\JFQHB2IT\Saliba R.M. et al. - 2021 - Mismatch in SIRPalpha, a regulatory protein in inn.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2014747055","adult; article; cumulative incidence; female; human; major clinical study; male; recurrence free survival; acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; *chronic graft versus host disease; *hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; *innate immunity; *regulator protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *signal regulatory protein alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; middle aged; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; unclassified drug","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We share an updated experience at our center of using in vivo dual T-cell depletion with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in peripheral blood haploHCT and report the impact of reducing the dose of ATG from 4.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg on post-transplantation complications and outcomes. Ninety-five consecutive adults underwent haploHCT at our center between August 2016 and February 2020, all of whom were included in the study. Nine (9.5%) patients received myeloablative conditioning, and 86 (90.5%) patients underwent reduced-intensity haploHCT. All patients received thymoglobulin, PTCy and cyclosporine (CsA) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Sixty (63.2%) patients received 4.5 mg/kg, and 35 (36.8%) patients received 2 mg/kg of ATG. Clinical information was collected retrospectively and updated in June 2020. The median age was 57 (18-73), and acute myeloid leukemia was the most prevalent diagnosis (58.9%). The day 100 cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGVHD, and 1-year moderate/severe cGVHD were 22.3%, 11.1%, and 20.2%, respectively. Those patients who received 2 mg/kg of ATG had higher incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD (23.9% vs 3.5%, P = .006) and comparable moderate/severe cGVHD (1-year 20.6% vs 19.8%, P = .824) than those patients who received 4.5 mg/kg. Overall, the 18-month overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 43.8%, 38.4%, and 40.2%, respectively. The reduction of the ATG dose did not have a significant impact in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, P = .847), RFS (HR 0.984, P = .955), and in NRM (HR 1.38; P = .348). The reduction of the ATG resulted in a negative impact on aGVHD without conferring any benefit in OS, RFS, and NRM. Consequently, the ATG dose used at our institution in combination with PTCy and CsA for haploHCT continues to be 4.5 mg/kg.Copyright © 2021","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","428.e1-428.e9","","5","27","","Transplant.

Viruses can be found in urine and serum samples of immunocompromised patients. Malignant diseases, age, cell source, day of granulocyte reconstitution, conditioning regimen, or use of total body irradiation may play an important role in BKV epidemiology, development of hemorrhagic cystitis course, and outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, clinical course, and risk factors for BKV-HC in children undergoing HCT. A total number of 133 patients who were prospectively tested for BKV colonization/infection were enrolled into this multicenter analysis. Episodes of BKV-HC occurred in 36/133 (27%) enrolled subjects. In a univariate analysis for BKV-HC incidence, the following factors were significant: age >5 years, peripheral blood transplantation, matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation, busulfan-cyclophosphamide-melphalan conditioning regimen, and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) diagnosis. Presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in liver and gut GVHD was a significant risk factor of BKV-HC. No BKV-attributed deaths were reported. In multivariate analysis, the incidence of HC was significantly higher in patients with AML, age >5 years, MUD transplants, and children with GVHD. HC is a frequent complication after HCT among children causes prolonged hospitalization but rarely contributes to death. We identified risk factors of BKV-HC development in children, with focus on aGVHD: we concluded that excessive immune reaction connected with GVHD and immunosuppression drugs might play a pivotal role in the development of BKV-HC.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","1283-1293","","5","100","","Ann.

The use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is now a well-established and widely used method for GVHD prophylaxis after HLA haploidentical HCT. However, the rationale for using PT-Cy in the setting of matched donor transplantation is less apparent, given the lesser degree of bidirectional alloreactivity. In this retrospective study, we investigated the role of PT-Cy as GVHD prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma underoing allo-HCT, among different donor types, to determine cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and impact on engraftment, progression-free survival (PFS), GVHD-free/relapse- free survival (GRFS), overall survival (OS), and NRM A total of 295 patients with MM underwent allo-HCT using grafts from a matched related donor (MRD; n = 67), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 72), mismatched related or unrelated donor (MMRD/MMUD, 1 antigen; n = 27), or haploidentical donor (haplo; n = 129) using PT-Cy between 2012 and 2018. In addition to PT-Cy, agents used in GVHD prophylaxis included calcineurin inhibitors in 239 patients (81%), with mycophenolate mofetil in 184 of those 239 (77%). For grade II-IV acute GVHD, the cumulative incidence at day +100 was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25% to 36%), 9% (95% CI, 5% to 12%) for grade III-IV acute GVHD, and 27% (95% CI, 21% to 32%) for chronic GVHD (limited, 21%; extensive, 6%), with no differences by donor type. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 19d (95% CI, 18-19), with no significant difference by donor type. The median time to platelet engraftment was delayed in haploidentical donor graft recipients (27 days versus 21 days; P < .001). Two-year OS, PFS, GRFS, and NRM were 51% (95% CI, 45% to 58%), 26% (95% CI, 20% to 32%), 24% (95% CI, 18% to 30%), and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%), respectively, with no significant difference between different donor types. In multivariable analyses, compared with the haplo donors, the use of MRDs was associated with significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.95; P = .029), and the use of MUDs was associated with a significantly higher GRFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.97; P = .034). There was a trend toward improved PFS with use of MUDs (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.04; P = .08). Our data show that PT-Cy in MM patients undergoing allo-HCT resulted in low rates of acute and chronic GVHD and led to favorable survival, especially in the matched related donor setting. © 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

In this study we retrospectively compared the outcome of pediatric patients undergoing T-replete haploidentical HSCT (Haplo) for acute leukemia with those undergoing transplantation from unrelated HLA-matched donor (MUD) and HLA mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) from 2012 to 2017 at our Center. Both univariable and multivariable analyses showed similar 5-year overall survival rates for MUD, MMUD, and Haplo patients: 71% (95% CI 56-86), 72% (95% CI 55-90), and 75% (95% CI 54-94), respectively (p = 0.97). Haplo patients showed reduced event-free survival rates compared to MUD and MMUD patients: 30% (95% CI 12-49) versus 70% (95% CI 55-84) versus 53% (95% CI 35-73), respectively (p = 0.007), but these data were not confirmed by a multivariable analysis. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were similar for the three groups. Therefore, our data confirm that Haplo is a suitable clinical option for pediatric patients needing HSCT when lacking both an MUD and an MMUD donor.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","586-595","","3","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\3BML3V7X\Saglio F. et al. - 2021 - Haploidentical HSCT with post transplantation cycl.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2006772076","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; *cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; article; controlled study; cyclosporine/cb [Drug Combination]; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; major clinical study; male; matched unrelated donor; mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; overall survival; retrospective study; tacrolimus/cb [Drug Combination]; tacrolimus/dt [Drug Therapy]; *haploidentical transplantation; acute graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; acute graft versus host disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; acute graft versus host disease/pc [Prevention]; chronic graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; chronic graft versus host disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; chronic graft versus host disease/pc [Prevention]; mortality; thymocyte antibody/dt [Drug Therapy]; thymocyte antibody/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; adolescent; child; infant; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy]; melphalan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; multivariate analysis; myeloablative conditioning; preschool child; thiotepa/dt [Drug Therapy]; thiotepa/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; univariate analysis; whole body radiation; *cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; *cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; survival rate; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; event free survival; fludarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; HLA matching; leukemia relapse; melphalan/cb [Drug Combination]; clinical outcome; *pediatric patient; school child; tacrolimus/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; mismatched unrelated donor; drug megadose; *acute leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *acute leukemia/th [Therapy]; busulfan; nonrelapse mortality; engraftment; thiotepa/cb [Drug Combination]; *unrelated donor; thymocyte antibody/cb [Drug Combination]; *acute leukemia/rt [Radiotherapy]; neovii; relapse incidence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Status at haplo-HCT was first complete remission (CR1) in 72.5% of patients, secondary AML was reported in 9.9%. Median follow-up was 24.4 months and median age at haplo-HCT was 51 years. Stem cell source was bone marrow (BM) in 42% and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) in 58%, and 64% of patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Cumulative incidence of primary graft failure (GF) was 6%; GF was reported in 110 patients and 54 died before day +30 with no sign of cell recovery. Overall, 33 patients underwent a second HCT in a median time of 45 days and 13 were alive at last follow-up, the 2-year overall survival (OS) after second HCT being 32.4%. In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with the risk of nonengraftment were: secondary AML (HR 1.30, p = 0.003), use of RIC (HR 1.22, p < 0.001), and use of BM (HR 1.21, p < 0.001). At 2 years, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and OS for the entire population was 55.2% (95% CI: 52.6-57.6) and 60.9% (95% CI: 58.4-63.3), respectively. Incidence of GF after haplo-HCT with PT-Cy is lower than reported T-cell-depleted haplo-HCT. Optimization of conditioning regimen and graft source should be considered for reducing the risk of GF in haplo-HCT recipients using PT-Cy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:21","2022-09-06 19:01:21","","1842-1849","","8","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\BBUW3CJN\Ruggeri A. et al. - 2021 - Prognostic factors for neutrophil engraftment afte.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010702828","*cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; *haploidentical transplantation; human cell; T cell depletion; middle aged; myeloablative conditioning; follow up; incidence; cancer specific survival; treatment outcome; *leukemia remission; risk factor; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; groups by age; *cancer prognosis; hematopoietic stem cell; graft failure; risk reduction; peripheral blood stem cell; *acute myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; population structure; *engraftment; *neutrophil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, large studies on Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are lacking. We analyzed haplo-HCT outcomes in 180 children with ALL. Median age was 9 years, and median follow-up was 2.7 years. Disease status was CR1 for 24%, CR2 for 45%, CR+3 for 12%, and active disease for 19%. All patients received PT-Cy day +3 and +4. Bone marrow (BM) was the stem cell source in 115 patients (64%). Cumulative incidence of 42-day engraftment was 88.9%. Cumulative incidence of day-100 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 28%, and 2-year chronic GVHD was 21.9%. At 2 years, cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19.6%. Cumulative incidence was 41.9% for relapse and 25% for patients in CR1. Estimated 2-year leukemia free survival was 65%, 44%, and 18.8% for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, CR3+ and 3% at 1 year for active disease. In multivariable analysis for patients in CR1 and CR2, disease status (CR2 [hazard ratio {HR} = 2.19; P = .04]), age at HCT older than 13 (HR = 2.07; P = .03) and use of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) (HR = 1.98; P = .04) were independent factors associated with decreased overall survival. Use of PBSC was also associated with higher NRM (HR = 3.13; P = .04). Haplo-HCT with PT-Cy is an option for children with ALL, namely those transplanted in CR1 and CR2. Age and disease status remain the most important factors for outcomes. BM cells as a graft source is associated with improved survival.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","424.e1-424.e9","","5","27","","Transplant.

This study focused on the real-world overall survival (OS) of MDS patients in association with comorbidities, specifically malignancies. An observational population-based study using the HemoBase registry was performed, including all patients with MDS diagnosed between 2005 and 2017 in Friesland, a Dutch province. Detailed information about diagnosis, patient characteristics, previous treatment of malignancies, and comorbidities according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was collected from electronic health records. Patients were followed up until June 2019. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression analyses were used to study survival differences. In the 291 patients diagnosed with MDS, the median OS was 25.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3-30.2). OS was significantly better for patients with CCI score ,4, age ,65 years, female sex, and low-risk MDS. Fifty-seven patients (20%) had encountered a prior malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and a majority (38 patients; 67%) were therapy related. Both therapy-related and secondary MDSs were associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.23 and 1.58; 95% CI, 0.95-2.65, respectively), as compared with de novo MDS patients (P 5 .04). Patients in remission at time of MDS diagnosis had a similar median OS compared with patients with de novo MDS (25.5 vs 28.3 months). This population-based study involving all newly diagnosed MDS patients over a 13-year period in Friesland showed that multiple comorbidities, including previous malignancies, are associated with shorter OS. OS was not related to the use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","1344-1351","","5","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\ZJF5UY5Z\Rozema J. et al. - 2021 - Comorbidities and malignancies negatively affect s.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011277524","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; priority journal; population research; cancer regression; cancer chemotherapy; observational study; Kaplan Meier method; proportional hazards model; *cancer survival; *myelodysplastic syndrome; diabetes mellitus; cancer radiotherapy; prostate cancer; kidney disease; Charlson Comorbidity Index; breast cancer; *comorbidity; *malignant neoplasm; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; chronic lung disease; colorectal cancer; electronic health record; endocrine cancer; endometrium cancer; lung cancer; melanoma; non melanoma skin cancer; urogenital tract cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the California Cancer Registry linked to statewide hospitalization data, we determined the cumulative incidence (CMI) of SPMs more than 1 year after MM diagnosis, accounting for the competing risk of death. AHSCT recipients were matched 1:2 to non-aHSCT patients. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated using the Fine and Gray method. Among 16,331 patients, 933 (5.7%) developed a SPM more than 1 year after diagnosis. The 10-year CMI of developing any SPM was 6.6%, 5.7% for solid tumor SPM and 0.9% for hematologic malignancies. The 10-year CMI of developing any SPM was similar among aHSCT [9.1% (7.7-10.7%)] and non-aHSCT [7.5% (6.5-8.6%)] (P = 0.26) recipients and there was no difference in solid-tumor SPMs (P = 0.98). The 10-year CMI of hematologic SPMs was higher among aHSCT recipients [2.1% (1.4-2.9%) vs. 0.8% (0.5-1.2%); P = 0.005], corresponding to a 1.3% absolute increase and an aHR of 1.51 (1.01-2.27). Ten-year myeloma-specific and non-cancer mortality rates were 59% (58.2-60.0%) and 18.1% (17.4-18.8%), respectively.

It can be primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or secondary myelofibrosis (SMF) evolving from polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the differences, PMF and SMF patients are currently managed in the same way, and prediction of survival is based on the same clinical and genetic features. In the last few years, interest has grown concerning the ability of gene expression profiles (GEPs) to provide valuable prognostic information. Here, we studied the GEPs of granulocytes from 114 patients with MF, using a microarray platform to identify correlations with patient characteristics and outcomes. Cox regression analysis led to the identification of 201 survival-related transcripts characterizing patients who are at high risk for death. High-risk patients identified by this gene signature displayed an inferior overall survival and leukemia-free survival, together with clinical and molecular detrimental features included in contemporary prognostic models, such as the presence of high molecular risk mutations. The high-risk group was enriched in post-PV and post-ET MF and JAK2V617F homozygous patients, whereas pre-PMF was more frequent in the low-risk group. These results demonstrate that GEPs in MF patients correlate with their molecular and clinical features, particularly their survival, and represent the proof of concept that GEPs might provide complementary prognostic information to be applied in clinical decision making.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","1452-1462","","5","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\7UY6XVZY\Rontauroli S. et al. - 2021 - Gene expression profile correlates with molecular .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011277532","adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; priority journal; cancer specific survival; homozygosity; high risk population; mortality risk; clinical feature; correlational study; low risk population; cancer classification; granulocyte; *gene expression profiling; *genetic correlation; *myelofibrosis; microarray analysis; mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal postremission therapy choice in this heterogeneous patient population is currently unsettled. In the current study, we compared outcomes in IRcyto AML recipients of autologous (autoSCT) (n = 312) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) (n = 279) in first complete remission (CR1). Molecular risk was defined based on CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-ITD mutational status, per European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria. Five-year overall survival (OS) in patients with favorable molecular risk (FRmol) was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-72) after autoSCT and 66% (95% CI, 41-83) after matched sibling donor (MSD) alloSCT (P = .68). For patients of intermediate molecular risk (IRmol), MSD alloSCT was associated with lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P < .001), as well as with increased nonrelapse mortality (P = .01), as compared to autoSCT. The 5-year OS was 47% (95% CI, 34-58) after autoSCT and 70% (95% CI, 59-79) after MSD alloSCT (P = .02) in this patient subgroup. In a propensity-score matched IRmol subcohort (n = 106), MSD alloSCT was associated with superior leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, P = .004) and increased OS in patients alive 1 year after transplantation (HR 0.20, P = .004). These results indicate that, within IRcyto AML in CR1, autoSCT may be a valid option for FRmol patients, whereas MSD alloSCT should be the preferred postremission strategy in IRmol patients.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","311.e1-311.e10","","4","27","","Transplant.

We evaluated the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in a retrospective review of 79 patients treated in standard fashion with PI3K inhibitor monotherapy or with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or as part of a novel combination regimen. Patients treated with a novel combination were at a higher risk of developing a severe AE compared to those treated with standard therapy (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.02, 3.49; p =.04). Additionally, previously untreated patients were at higher risk of developing a severe AE compared to previously treated patients (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.48, 6.84; p =.003).

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197 RRMM patients (pts) between January 2016 and March 2018 in six Italian hematologic centers, with the aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of KRd in real-life. At KRd initiation 27% carried high risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCA) [del17p and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (1-8), nearly all pts (96%) received prior bortezomib (18% refractory) while 45% were exposed to lenalidomide (R; 22% refractory). At the median of 12.5 months, 52% of the pts had discontinued treatment, mainly (66%) for progression. Main grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (21%), infections (11%), and hypertension (6%). Overall, the response rate was 88%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 19.8 months and 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.6%. By subgroup analysis, extended PFS and OS were observed for pts who received <=2 prior lines of therapy (HR = 0.42, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.35, p = 0.001, respectively), not refractory to prior R (HR = 0.37, p < 0.001, and HR = 0.47, p = 0.024), without HRCA (HR = 0.33, p = 0.005 and HR = 0.26, p = 0.016) and achieving >= very good partial response (VGPR; HR = 0.17, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.18, p < 0.001). In conclusion, KRd demonstrated to be effective in RRMM pts treated in real-world setting, without new safety concerns. Better survival outcomes emerged for pts with <=2 prior lines of therapy, achieving at least a VGPR, and without HRCA.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","41-50","","1","39","","Hematol.

In this multi-institutional retrospective analysis, we assessed the genetic features and clinical outcomes of 43 patients with ASXL1mutSRSF2mut AML and compared outcomes to patients with either ASXL1 (n = 57) or SRSF2 (n = 70) mutations. Twenty-six (60%) had secondary-AML (s-AML). Variant allele fractions suggested that SRSF2 mutations preceded ASXL1 mutational events. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.0 months (95% CI:3.8,15.3) and was significantly longer in patients with de novo vs s-AML (15.3 vs 6.4 months, respectively; P =.04 on adjusted analysis). Compared to ASXL1mutSRSF2wt and ASXL1wtSRSF2mut, co-mutated patients had a 1.4 and 1.6 times increase in the probability of death, respectively (P =.049), with a trend towards inferior OS (median OS = 7.0 vs 11.5 vs 10.9 months, respectively; P =.10). Multivariable analysis suggests this difference in OS is attributable to the high proportion of s-AML patients in the co-mutated cohort (60% vs 32% and 23%, respectively). Although this study is limited by the retrospective data collection and the relatively small sample size, these data suggest that ASXL1mutSRSF2mut AML is a distinct subgroup of AML frequently associated with s-AML and differs from ASXL1mutSRSF2wt/ASXL1wtSRSF2mut with respect to etiology and leukemogenesis.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","462-470","","4","96","","Am.

Compared with Vd, XVd was associated with significant improvements in median progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and lower rates of peripheral neuropathy, with trends in overall survival (OS) favoring XVd. In BOSTON, 141 (35.1%) patients had MM with high-risk (presence of del[17p], t[4;14], t[14;16], or >=4 copies of amp1q21) cytogenetics (XVd, n = 70; Vd, n = 71), and 261 (64.9%) exhibited standard-risk cytogenetics (XVd, n = 125; Vd, n = 136). Among patients with high-risk MM, median PFS was 12.91 months for XVd and 8.61 months for Vd (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, (0.4673, 1.1406)], p = 0.082), and ORRs were 78.6% and 57.7%, respectively (OR 2.68; p = 0.004).

We analyzed the outcomes and prognostic factors for CR to salvage therapy and overall survival (OS) of patients with R/R T-ALL included in two prospective measurable residual disease-oriented trials. Seventy-five patients (70 relapsed, 5 refractory) were identified. Relapses occurred in bone marrow, isolated or combined in 50 patients, and in the central nervous system (CNS; isolated or combined) in 20. Second CR was attained in 30/75 patients (40%). Treatment with FLAG-Ida and isolated CNS relapse were independently associated with a higher CR rate after first salvage therapy. The median OS was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-8.6) months, with a 4-year OS probability of 18% (95% CI, 9%-27%). No differences in survival were observed according to the treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients in CR after first salvage therapy. Multivariable analysis showed a >=12-month interval between first CR and relapse, CR after first salvage therapy and isolated CNS relapse as favorable prognostic factors for OS with hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of 1.931 (1.109-3.362), 2.958 (1.640-5.334), and 2.976 (1.157-7.655), respectively. This study confirms the poor outcomes of adults with R/R T-ALL among whom FLAG-Ida was the best of the rescue therapies evaluated. Late relapse, CR after first rescue therapy and isolated CNS relapse showed prognostic impact on survival. More effective rescue therapies are needed in adults with R/R T-ALL.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","529-538","","4","39","","Hematol.

The aim of the ALL-HR-11 trial was to evaluate the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients following chemotherapy or allo-HSCT administered based on end-induction and consolidation MRD levels. Patients aged 15 to 60 years with HR-ALL in complete response (CR) and MRD levels (centrally assessed by 8-color flow cytometry) <0.1% after induction and <0.01% after early consolidation were assigned to receive delayed consolidation and maintenance therapy up to 2 years in CR. The remaining patients were allocated to allo-HSCT. CR was attained in 315/348 patients (91%), with MRD <0.1% after induction in 220/289 patients (76%). By intention-to-treat, 218 patients were assigned to chemotherapy and 106 to allo-HSCT. The 5-year (+/-95% confidence interval) cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival probabilities for the whole series were 43% +/- 7%, 49% +/- 7%, and 40% +/- 6%, respectively, with CIR and OS rates of 45% +/- 8% and 59% +/- 9% for patients assigned to chemotherapy and of 40% +/- 12% and 38% +/- 11% for those assigned to allo-HSCT, respectively. Our results show that avoiding allo-HSCT does not hamper the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients up to 60 years with adequate MRD response after induction and consolidation.

We identified TERT rare variants in 41 of 1514 MDS patients (2.7%) without a clinical diagnosis of a telomere biology disorder who underwent allogeneic transplantation. Patients with a TERT rare variant had shorter telomere length (P < .001) and younger age at MDS diagnosis (52 vs 59 years, P = .03) than patients without a TERT rare variant. In multivariable models, TERT rare variants were associated with inferior overall survival (P = .034) driven by an increased incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM; P = .015). Death from a noninfectious pulmonary cause was more frequent among patients with a TERT rare variant. Most variants were missense substitutions and classified as variants of unknown significance. Therefore, we cloned all rare missense variants and quantified their impact on telomere elongation in a cell-based assay. We found that 90% of TERT rare variants had severe or intermediate impairment in their capacity to elongate telomeres. Using a homology model of human TERT bound to the shelterin protein TPP1, we inferred that TERT rare variants disrupt domain-specific functions, including catalysis, protein-RNA interactions, and recruitment to telomeres. Our results indicate that the contribution of TERT rare variants to MDS pathogenesis and NRM risk is underrecognized. Routine screening for TERT rare variants in MDS patients regardless of age or clinical suspicion may identify clinically inapparent telomere biology disorders and improve transplant outcomes through risk-adapted approaches.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:22","2022-09-06 19:01:22","","898-911","","10","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","; C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\PI645VE8\Reilly C.R. et al. - 2021 - The clinical and functional effects of TERT varian.pdf","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2014473975","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cumulative incidence; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; human cell; mortality; adolescent; child; infant; acute myeloid leukemia; myeloablative conditioning; reduced intensity conditioning; *myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; recurrence risk; clinical outcome; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer chemotherapy; disease severity; drug megadose; autologous stem cell transplantation; DNA methyltransferase 3A/ec [Endogenous Compound]; genetic association; antineoplastic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; cause of death; newborn; somatic mutation; gene frequency; single nucleotide polymorphism; International Prognostic Scoring System; nucleic acid isolation kit; *myelodysplastic syndrome/et [Etiology]; real time polymerase chain reaction; cytopenia; nonhodgkin lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; Karnofsky Performance Status; *genetic variability; *molecular pathology; *telomerase reverse transcriptase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; aplasia; catalysis; cryoelectron microscopy; follicular lymphoma/th [Therapy]; human chromosome; immunosuppressive agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; interactions with RNA; laboratory software; missense mutation; nonhodgkin lymphoma/th [Therapy]; telomere length; tumor engraftment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty-six percent received one, 14% two induction cycles, and 10% received consolidation (representing 22% of patients with CR/CRi) with CPX-351. Following induction, CR/CRi rate was 47% including 64% of patients with available information achieving measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity (<10-3) as measured by flow cytometry. After a median follow-up of 9.3 months, median overall survival (OS) was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 64%. In multivariate analysis, complex karyotype predicted lower response (p = 0.0001), while pretreatment with hypomethylating agents (p = 0.02) and adverse European LeukemiaNet 2017 genetic risk (p < 0.0001) were associated with lower OS.

However, whether NK cell determinants predict protection against relapse for JMML patients undergoing HCT is unknown. Therefore, we investigated NK cell-related donor and recipient immunogenetics as determinants of HCT outcomes in patients with JMML. Patients with JMML (age 0 to <19 years) who underwent a first allogeneic HCT from an unrelated donor between 2000 and 2017 and had available donor samples from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Repository were included. Donor killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) typing was performed on pre-HCT samples. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included relapse, grade II-IV acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), GVHD-free relapse-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, and overall survival (OS). Donor KIR models tested included KIR genotype (AA versus Bx), B content (0-1 versus >=2), centromeric and telomeric region score (AA versus AB versus BB), B content score (best, better, or neutral), composite score (2 versus 3 versus 4), activating KIR content, and the presence of KIR2DS4. Ligand-ligand and KIR-ligand mismatch effects on outcomes were analyzed in HLA-mismatched donors (<=7/8; n = 74) only. Univariate analyses were performed for primary and secondary outcomes of interest, with a P value <.05 considered significant. One hundred sixty-five patients (113 males), with a median follow-up of 85 months (range, 6 to 216 months) met the study criteria. Of these, 111 underwent an unrelated donor HCT and 54 underwent a UCB HCT. Almost all (n = 161; 98%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. After exclusion of recipients of reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens and ex vivo T cell-depleted grafts (n = 8), there were 42 AA donors and 115 Bx donors, respectively. Three-year DFS, OS, relapse, and GRFS for the entire cohort were 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 66%), 67% (95% CI, 59% to 74%), 26% (95% CI, 19% to 33%), and 27% (95% CI, 19% to 35%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD at 100 days was 36% (95% CI, 27% to 44%), and that of cGVHD at 1 year was 23% (95% CI, 17% to 30%). There were no differences between AA donors and Bx donors for any recipient survival outcomes. The risk of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in patients with donors with a B content score of >=2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.83; P = .01), an activating KIR content score of >3 (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.95; P = .032), centromeric A/B score (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 033 to 0.98; P = .041), and telomeric A/B score (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.00; P = .048). To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the association of NK cell determinants and outcomes in JMML HCT recipients. This study identifies potential benefits of donor KIR-B genotypes in reducing aGVHD. Our findings warrant further study of the role of NK cells in enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect via recognition of JMML blasts.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:23","2022-09-06 19:01:23","","926.e1-926.e10","","(Rangarajan, Kussman, Lee) Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplant, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, United States","","","Transplant.

The effectiveness of second-line treatments is uncertain. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical effectiveness and overall survival (OS) of lower-risk MDS without del(5q) patients exclusively treated with stanozolol (STZ) after failure of epoetin alfa. The response was defined according to the 2006 International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Fifty-six patients were included. The median follow-up time was 55 months (range: 5-156 months). Twenty-seven patients (48.2%) achieved hematologic improvement-erythroid response (HI-E). Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower IPSS-R scores (<=3.5, P = 0.008) and hypocellular bone marrow (P = 0.002). In univariate Cox analysis, HI-E was the strongest factor associated with better OS (P = 0.0003). In multivariate Cox, HI-E, age <= 50, and transfusion independence (TI) at the onset of STZ were factors associated with better OS. The estimated 5-year OS was 88.6% (68.7-96.2%) and 33.8% (14.9-54.0%) in responders and non-responders (P < 0.01), respectively. The most common side effects included masculinization and liver damage, but they were manageable with supportive measures and dose adjustments.

However, the prognostic value and prediction of HSCT-associated severe bleeding in GVHD patients have not been reported in cohort studies. We did a retrospective analysis of 200 AL patients with GVHD after allo-HSCT from Feb 1, 2014, to Dec 1, 2015. Multivariate analysis showed that the severe bleeding class was associated with the risk of death (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.31-3.92, p<0.001***). In order to predict severe bleeding and figure out the solution to bleeding events, we established a multiple logistic regression model. HLA-DQB1 unmatching, megakaryocyte reconsititution failure, and III or IV GVHD were the independent risk factors for severe bleeding. Among all the variations above, OR of HLA-DQB1 was the highest (OR: 16.02, 95% CI: 11.54-48.68). Adding HLA-DQB1 to other factors improved the reclassification for predicting severe bleeding (NRI=0.195, z=2.634, p=0.008**; IDI=0.289, z=3.249, p<0.001***). Lasso regression was used to select variants. A nomogram of the logistic model was generated and displayed.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). With a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 0-54), no significant differences in the median PFS were observed between the two arms (C-Rd 23 months, Rd 29 months; HR 0.783, p = 0.14), despite a higher rate of complete response (CR) or better in the C-Rd group (22.6% vs 14.4%, p = 0.048). The most common G3-4 adverse events were neutropenia [12% vs 19%] and infections [30% vs 25%], similar between the two arms; however, the percentage of toxic deaths was higher in the C-Rd group (36/50 [72%] vs 22/40 [55%], p = 0.09). The addition of clarithromycin to Rd in untreated transplant ineligible MM patients does not improve PFS despite increasing the >=CR rate due to the higher number of toxic deaths in the C-Rd arm. Side effects related to overexposure to steroids due to its delayed clearance induced by clarithromycin in this elderly population could explain these results.

However, the clinical significance of FCM positivity with a negative cytology (i.e., occult central nervous system [CNS] disease) is not clear. In the framework of the national Campus ALL program, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of occult CNS disease and its impact on outcome in 240 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL. All CSF samples were investigated by CC and FCM. The presence of >=10 phenotypically abnormal events, forming a cluster, was considered to be FCM positivity. No CNS involvement was documented in 179 patients, while 18 were positive by modified conventional morphology with CC and 43 were occult CNS disease positive. The relapse rate was significantly lower in CNS disease negative patients and the disease-free and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer in CNS disease negative patients than in those with manifest or occult CNS disease positivity. In multivariate analysis, the status of manifest and occult CNS disease positivity was independently associated with a worse OS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in adult ALL patients at diagnosis FCM can detect occult CNS disease at high sensitivity and that the status of occult CNS disease positivity is associated with an adverse outcome.

To evaluate the characteristics and the impact of this metabolic reprogramming, we explore the bone marrow samples from 54 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on proton high-resolution magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance. The spectra obtained were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis to find specific metabolome alterations and biomarkers correlated to clinical features. We found that patients display a large diversity of metabolic profiles, according to the different AML cytologic subtypes and molecular statuses. The link between metabolism and molecular status was particularly strong for the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), whose intracellular production is directly linked to the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations. Moreover, patients' prognosis was strongly impacted by several metabolites, such as 2-HG that appeared as a good prognostic biomarker in our cohort. Conversely, deregulations in phospholipid metabolism had a negative impact on prognosis through 2 main metabolites (phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine), which could be potential aggressiveness biomarkers. Finally, we highlighted an overexpression of glutathione and alanine in chemoresistant patients. Overall, our results demonstrate that different metabolic pathways could be activated in leukemic cells according to their phenotype and maturation levels. This confirms that metabolic reprogramming strongly influences prognosis of patients and underscores a particular role of certain metabolites and associated pathways in AML prognosis, suggesting common mechanisms developed by leukemic cells to maintain their aggressiveness even after well-conducted induction chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:23","2022-09-06 19:01:23","","156-166","","1","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\MEGQYS5R\Presti C.L. et al. - 2021 - The metabolic reprogramming in acute myeloid leuke.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010630615","adult; article; cohort analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; human cell; prospective study; middle aged; priority journal; human tissue; *genotype; cancer chemotherapy; flow cytometry; phenotype; clinical feature; NPM1 gene; nucleophosmin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; biological marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]; gene mutation; *cancer prognosis; bone marrow; CD135 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; flt3 gene; signal transduction; 2 hydroxyglutaric acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; clinical decision making; tumor marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]; leukemia cell; *de novo acute myeloid leukemia; *nuclear reprogramming; *tumor metabolism; alanine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; cell maturation; cytology; deregulation; gene overexpression; glutathione/ec [Endogenous Compound]; IDH gene; isocitrate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; lipid metabolism; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolic regulation; metabolome; metabolomics; mutator gene; phosphoethanolamine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; phospholipid metabolism; phospholipid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; phosphorylcholine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; proton high resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance; proton nuclear magnetic resonance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hematologic response rate for all patients was 68%; 63% achieved VGPR/CR. t(11;14) patients had higher hematologic response (81% vs. 40%) and higher VGPR/CR rate (78% vs. 30%, odds ratio: 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.62) than non-t(11;14) patients. For the unsegregated cohort, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 31.0 months and median OS was not reached (NR). For t(11;14), median PFS was NR and for non-t(11;14) median PFS was 6.7 months (HR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.53). Multivariate analysis incorporating age, sex, prior lines of therapy, and disease stage suggested a risk reduction for progression or death in t(11;14) patients. Median OS was NR for either subgroup. The organ response rate was 38%; most responders harbored t(11;14). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 19% with 7% due to infections. These promising results require confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:23","2022-09-06 19:01:23","","10","","1","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\SFFYFD5J\Premkumar V.J. et al. - 2021 - Venetoclax induces deep hematologic remissions in .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010154170","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; female; human; male; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; multicenter study; melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy]; age; monotherapy; treatment response; diarrhea/si [Side Effect]; dyspnea/si [Side Effect]; mortality risk; autologous stem cell transplantation; lenalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; proteasome inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]; dizziness/si [Side Effect]; fatigue/si [Side Effect]; leukopenia/si [Side Effect]; nausea/si [Side Effect]; neutropenia/si [Side Effect]; pneumonia/si [Side Effect]; sepsis/si [Side Effect]; thrombocytopenia/si [Side Effect]; doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; pomalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; clinical article; *remission; infection/si [Side Effect]; median survival time; risk reduction; bronchitis/si [Side Effect]; thorax pain/si [Side Effect]; upper respiratory tract infection/si [Side Effect]; combination drug therapy; abdominal pain/si [Side Effect]; influenza/si [Side Effect]; sex difference; cellulitis/si [Side Effect]; rash/si [Side Effect]; *venetoclax/dt [Drug Therapy]; herpes zoster/si [Side Effect]; bendamustine/dt [Drug Therapy]; daratumumab/dt [Drug Therapy]; elotuzumab/dt [Drug Therapy]; *AL amyloidosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *AL amyloidosis/th [Therapy]; *relapsed refractory al amyloidosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *relapsed refractory al amyloidosis/th [Therapy]; *venetoclax/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; chest infection/si [Side Effect]; colitis/si [Side Effect]; glucocorticoid/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib as a single agent, in a real-life context, in 180 patients with CLL mostly pretreated, recruited from three independent cohorts from Italy. Patients received 420 mg oral ibrutinib once daily until progression or occurrence of unacceptable side effects. Seventy-three patients discontinued ibrutinib for progression or for adverse events. NOTCH1 mutations (NOTCH1 M) were correlated with a reduced redistribution lymphocytosis, calculated at 3 months on ibrutinib (P=0.022). Moreover, NOTCH1 M patients showed inferior nodal response at 6 months on ibrutinib compared to NOTCH1 wild-type patients (P<0.0001). Significant shorter progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed in NOTCH1 M patients (P=0.00002 and P=0.001). Interestingly, NOTCH1 M plus a lower BAX/BCL-2 ratio identified a CLL subset showing the worst PFS and OS (P=0.0002 and P=0.005). In multivariate analysis of PFS and OS, NOTCH1 M were confirmed an independent prognosticator (P=0.00006 and P=0.0039). In conclusion, NOTCH1 M are strongly associated with a lower BAX/BCL-2 ratio, consistent with defective apoptosis, lower redistribution lymphocytosis and lower nodal shrinkage under ibrutinib treatment, this last paramter being responsible for partial responses, subsequent relapses, as well as shorter PFS and OS. Either new small molecule combination approaches or antibodies targeting NOTCH1 could be future therapeutic options for NOTCH1 M patients.Copyright ©2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:23","2022-09-06 19:01:23","","2345-2353","","9","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\IXYTFK9U\Poeta G.D. et al. - 2021 - Impaired nodal shrinkage and apoptosis define the .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2014400379","aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; follow up; cyclophosphamide; lymphocyte count; flow cytometry; phenotype; maintenance therapy; gene mutation; somatic mutation; chronic lymphatic leukemia; gene frequency; *lymphatic leukemia; genetic analysis; systemic lupus erythematosus; *apoptosis; *ibrutinib/po [Oral Drug Administration]; *Notch1 receptor; cytotoxicity; immunoglobulin; lymphocytosis; pyrosequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to investigate whether hypomethylating agents provide a benefit in subgroups of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia compared with other treatments. Method(s): For this retrospective cohort study, data were retrieved between Nov 30, 2017, and Jan 5, 2019, from 38 centres in the USA and Europe. We included non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, who received chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-directed therapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia according to 2016 WHO criteria at initial diagnosis (ie, >=20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood) or with unavailability of treatment data were excluded. Outcomes assessed included overall survival, time to next treatment, and time to transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, platelet count, and Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-Specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS). Patients were grouped by first received treatment with either hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents, or intensive chemotherapy, and stratified by risk according to blast count, French-American-British subtype, CPSS, WHO 2016 subtype, and the eligibility criteria of the DACOTA trial (NCT02214407). Finding(s): 949 patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia between April 13, 1981, and Oct 26, 2018, were included. Median follow-up was 23.4 months (IQR 11.5-42.3) from diagnosis and 16.2 months (6.6-31.6) from start of first-line treatment. 412 (43%) of 949 patients received hypomethylating agents as first treatment, 391 (41%) hydroxyurea, and 83 (9%) intensive chemotherapy. Adjusted median overall survival for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents was 15.6 months (95% CI 13.1-17.3) versus 20.7 months (17.9-23.4); hazard ratio (HR) 1.39 (1.17-1.65; p=0.0002) and 14.0 months (9.8-17.2) versus 20.7 months (17.9-23.4; HR 1.55 [1.16-2.05]; p=0.0027) for those treated with intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. In patients with myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (myeloproliferative CMML), median overall survival was 12.6 months (10.7-15.0) versus 17.6 months (14.8-21.5; HR 1.38 [1.12-1.70]; p=0.0027) for patients treated with hydroxyurea versus hypomethylating agents, and 12.3 months (8.4-16.6) versus 17.6 months (14.8-21.5; HR 1.44 [1.02-2.03]; p=0.040) for intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agents. Hypomethylating agents did not confer an overall survival advantage for patients classified as having lower-risk disease (ie, myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with <10% blasts, CMML-0, or lower-risk CPSS). Interpretation(s): These data suggest hypomethylating agents as the preferred therapy for patients with higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and those with myeloproliferative CMML. Our findings also suggest that CPSS is a valuable tool to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from hypomethylating agents. Further evidence from prospective cohorts would be desirable.

Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. Method(s): Titration was done using LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher' exact test and the Mann-Whitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively. Result(s): At 5 weeks, GMC of IgG in elderly controls was 353.3 AU/mL versus 106.7 in MM (p = 0.003) and 172.9 in MPM patients (p = 0.049). Seroprotection rate at cutoff of 15 AU/mL was 100% in controls compared to 78.6% in MM (p = 0.003) and 88% in MPM patients (p = 0.038). In terms of logarithm of IgG titer, in a generalized multivariate linear model, no gender effect was observed (p = 0.913), while there was a significant trend toward lower titers by increasing age (p < 0.001) and in disease cohorts with respect to controls (MM: p < 0.001 and MPM: p < 0.001). An ongoing treatment without daratumumab was associated with higher likelihood of response in MM patients (p = 0.003). No swabs resulted positive on each time point. No safety concerns were observed. Conclusion(s): BNT162b2 has demonstrated to be immunogenic at different extent among the cohorts. Response was 88% and robust in MPM patients. MM patients responded significantly less, particularly those on anti-CD38-based treatment. These latter patients should be advised to maintain masks and social distancing regardless of vaccination status, and their cohabiting family members need to be vaccinated in order to reduce the risk of contagion from the family. Additional boosters and titer monitoring could be considered. Trial registration Study was formally approved by the IRCCS Central Ethical Committee of Regione Lazio in January 2021 (Prot.

Because studies evaluating humoral response to COVID-19 vaccine in these patients are lacking, recommendations regarding vaccination strategy remain unclear. The humoral immune response to BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated in patients with B-NHL who received 2 vaccine doses 21 days apart and compared with the response in healthy controls. Antibody titer, measured by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2S assay, was evaluated 2 to 3 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Patients with B-NHL (n 5 149), aggressive B-NHL (a-B-NHL; 47%), or indolent B-NHL (i-B-NHL; 53%) were evaluated. Twenty-eight (19%) were treatment naive, 37% were actively treated with a rituximab/ obinutuzumab (R/Obi) based induction regimen or R/Obi maintenance, and 44% had last been treated with R/Obi .6 months before vaccination. A seropositive response was achieved in 89%, 7.3%, and 66.7%, respectively, with response rates of 49% in patients with B-NHL vs 98.5% in 65 healthy controls (P , .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that longer time since exposure to R/Obi and absolute lymphocyte count $0.9 3 103/mL predicted a positive serological response. Median time to achieve positive serology among anti-CD20 antibody-Treated patients was longer in i-B-NHL vs a-B-NHL. The humoral response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is impaired in patients with B-NHL who are undergoing R/Obi treatment. Longer time since exposure to R/Obi is associated with improved response rates to the COVID-19 vaccine.

We examined the effect of depth of clinical response, including incomplete count recovery (CRi) and/or measurable residual disease (MRD), in patients from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) registry. We identified 2492 adult patients (1799 CR and 693 CRi) who underwent alloHCT between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors. Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients in CRi compared to those in CR had an increased likelihood of death (HR: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.43). Compared to CR, CRi was significantly associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM), shorter disease-free survival (DFS), and a trend toward increased relapse. Detectable MRD was associated with shorter OS, shorter DFS, higher NRM, and increased relapse compared to absence of MRD. The deleterious effects of CRi and MRD were independent.

The objective was to determine whether TE during treatment was associated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Cancer in Young People-Canada registry. Children <15 years of age were diagnosed with de novo ALL (2000-2016). The primary exposure variable was radiologically-confirmed thrombo-embolism requiring medical intervention. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to determine the impact of thrombo-embolism on survival, where TE was time-dependent. We included 2006 children (median age: 4 years, 88.5% precursor B-cell ALL). Thrombo-embolism occurred in 113 patients (5.6%), at a median time of 107 days (interquartile range: 35-184 days) after ALL diagnosis. Among standard/low-risk patients, 41/1165 (3.5%) developed TE while among high/very high-risk patients, 72/841 (8.6%) developed TE. Patients with TE had a significantly worse OS (adjusted HR [aHR] of death: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.62-4.22, p < 0.001) and EFS (aHR of an event [death, relapse, second malignancy]: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.35-3.05, p = 0.001), compared with patients without TE. No statistically significant difference was seen in standard/low risk ALL for OS and EFS, but TE was associated with a significantly lower OS and EFS in children with high/very high-risk ALL (aHR of death: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.79-4.72, p < 0.001; aHR of an event: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.30-3.12, p = 0.002). Thus, TE led to a statistically significant reduction in OS and EFS in children with high risk/very high-risk leukemia.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","796-804","","7","96","","Am.

The study included 479 patients with myelofibrosis recruited from 24 French Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM) centers. The molecular landscape was studied by high-throughput sequencing of 77 genes. A Bayesian network allowed the identification of genomic groups whose prognostic impact was studied in a multistate model considering transitions from the 3 conditions: Myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, and death. Results were validated using an independent, previously published cohort (n 5 276). Four genomic groups were identified: Patients with TP53 mutation; patients with $1 mutation in EZH2, CBL, U2AF1, SRSF2, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, or KRAS (highrisk group); patients with ASXL1-only mutation (ie, no associated mutation in TP53 or highrisk genes); and other patients. A multistate model found that both TP53 and high-risk groups were associated with leukemic transformation (hazard ratios [HRs] [95% confidence interval], 8.68 [3.32-22.73] and 3.24 [1.58-6.64], respectively) and death from myelofibrosis (HRs, 3.03 [1.66-5.56] and 1.77 [1.18-2.67], respectively). ASXL1-only mutations had no prognostic value that was confirmed in the validation cohort. However, ASXL1 mutations conferred a worse prognosis when associated with a mutation in TP53 or high-risk genes. This study provides a new definition of adverse mutations in myelofibrosis with the addition of TP53, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, and U2AF1 to previously described genes. Furthermore, our results argue that ASXL1 mutations alone cannot be considered detrimental.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","1442-1451","","5","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\TEAKWS8T\Paz D.L. et al. - 2021 - Genomic analysis of primary and secondary myelofib.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011277531","article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; human cell; priority journal; *gene; *genetic analysis; genetic susceptibility; *gene mutation; high throughput sequencing; NRAS gene; IDH2 gene; somatic mutation; *ASXL1 gene; TP53 gene; genetic variation; death; srsf2 gene; Ezh2 gene; gene identification; CBL gene; IDH1 gene; U2AF1 gene; *genetic predisposition; *myelofibrosis/et [Etiology]; acute leukemia/et [Etiology]; Bayesian network; KRAS gene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ITA-HEMA-COV project (NCT04352556) investigated patterns of seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with HMs. A total of 237 patients, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive with at least one SARS-CoV-2 IgG test performed during their care, entered the analysis. Among these, 62 (26.2%) had myeloid, 121 (51.1%) lymphoid and 54 (22.8%) plasma cell neoplasms. Overall, 69% of patients (164 of 237) had detectable IgG SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Serologically negative patients (31%, 73 of 237) were evenly distributed across patients with myeloid, lymphoid and plasma cell neoplasms. In the multivariable logistic regression, chemoimmunotherapy [odds ratio (OR), 3.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-11.21; P = 0.04] was associated with a lower rate of seroconversion. This effect did not decline after 180 days from treatment withdrawal (OR, 0.35; 95% CI: 0.11-1.13; P = 0.08). This study demonstrates a low rate of seroconversion in HM patients and indicates that treatment-mediated immune dysfunction is the main driver. As a consequence, we expect a low rate of seroconversion after vaccination and thus we suggest testing the efficacy of seroconversion in HM patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.British Journal of Haematology published by British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","371-377","","3","195","","Br.

Covid-19 vaccines offer the potential for protection against severe infection but relatively little is known regarding the profile of the antibody response following first or second vaccination. We studied spike-specific antibody responses following first and/or second Covid-19 vaccination in 299 patients with CLL compared with healthy donors. 286 patients underwent extended interval (10-12 week) vaccination. 154 patients received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and 145 patients received ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken either by venepuncture or as dried blood spots on filter paper. Spike-specific antibody responses were detectable in 34% of patients with CLL after one vaccine (n = 267) compared to 94% in healthy donors with antibody titres 104-fold lower in the patient group. Antibody responses increased to 75% after second vaccine (n = 55), compared to 100% in healthy donors, although titres remained lower. Multivariate analysis showed that current treatment with BTK inhibitors or IgA deficiency were independently associated with failure to generate an antibody response after the second vaccine. This work supports the need for optimisation of vaccination strategy in patients with CLL including the potential utility of booster vaccines.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","136","","7","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\CXSPTXQX\Parry H. et al. - 2021 - Antibody responses after first and second Covid-19.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2013320580","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; *coronavirus disease 2019; drug combination; drug therapy; *cancer patient; treatment failure; *vaccination; antibody titer; *chronic lymphatic leukemia; *antibody response; Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor; chadox1 ncov 19; filter; immunoglobulin A deficiency; spike; tozinameran; vein puncture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of 107 patients receiving DM for RRMM. The cohort included 64 trial-unfit patients whose characteristics could not meet inclusion criteria in two previous clinical trials (GEN501 and SIRIUS). The overall response rate (ORR), and median first and second progression-free survival (PFS1 and PFS2) and overall survival were 42.1%, and 3.6, 8.1 and 11.9 months, respectively. Refractoriness to carfilzomib and/or lenalidomide, and neutropenia (<1.0 x 109/l) resulted in poorer ORRs. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of >=3, neutropenia (<1.0 x 109/l), thrombocytopenia (<75 x 109/l), and renal failure (glomerular filtration rate of <20 ml/min/1.73 m2) were associated with poor PFS1 and PFS2 in respective univariate analysis. The modified trial-unfit group, based on the above factors, showed significantly negative impacts on PFS1 and PFS2 (hazard ratio 2.823 and 3.677, all P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis despite having a 34% ORR. Fatal infections occurred more often in the modified trial-unfit group than in the others (16.1% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.099). Despite failure of DM, subsequent therapy with pomalidomide-based therapy or carfilzomib-dexamethasone provided a 66.6% ORR. Real-world DM showed favourable efficacies for RRMM and, potentially, additional benefits with subsequent therapies. However, characteristics corresponding with trial-unfitness might offset the efficacy of DM.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","101-112","","1","193","","Br.

After a median follow up of 7 years, the risk of disease progression needing therapy was 2.9%/y for MBL (median, not reached) and 5%/y for Rai 0 CLL (median, 10.4 years). Among patients with low, intermediate, and high/very high-risk CLL-IPI risk groups, the estimated 5-year risk of TTFT was 13.5%, 30%, and 58%, respectively, P < .0001 (c-statistic = 0.69); and the estimated 5-year OS was 96.3%, 91.5%, and 76%, respectively, P < .0001 (c-statistic = 0.65). In a multivariable analysis of absolute B-cell count with individual factors of the CLL-IPI, the absolute B-cell count was associated with shorter TTFT (hazard ratio [HR] for each 10 x 109/L increase: 1.31; P < .0001) and shorter OS (HR: 1.1; P = .02). The OS of the entire cohort was similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general population of Minnesota (P = .17), although Rai 0 CLL patients with high and very high-risk CLL-IPI score had significantly shorter OS (P = .01 and P = .0001, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate the ability of CLL-IPI to predict time from diagnosis to first treatment (an end point not affected by therapy) in a large cohort of patients whose only manifestation of disease is a circulating clonal lymphocyte population.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","149-159","","2","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\FM94SWL3\Parikh S.A. et al. - 2021 - The CLL International Prognostic Index predicts ou.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2013576832","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; human cell; cancer survival; follow up; clinical outcome; risk factor; lymphocyte count; cancer growth; high risk patient; low risk patient; gene mutation; *cancer prognosis; intermediate risk patient; predictive value; *chronic lymphatic leukemia; *International Prognostic Index; *monoclonal b cell lymphocytosis; B lymphocyte; lymphocyte subpopulation; Minnesota","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these, 135 patients had immune-related conditions, including infections, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders at the time of diagnosis of MGUS. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma or a related disorder at 5 years and 10 years was 6.0% and 13.8%, respectively. The size of M protein was a significant risk factor for progression (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-7.9). There was a trend that the risk of progression was higher in patients without immune-related conditions (HR 2.36, 95% CI 0.85-6.52, p = 0.088). The M protein resolved in 36 (14%) patients, with a greater likelihood of resolution in patients with immune-related conditions (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.6). Young patients with MGUS have a similar risk of progression as older patients, 1.4% per year. Over 50% are diagnosed in the setting of immune-related disorders.

We analyzed 1076 AML patients in first remission after induction chemotherapy, in whom MRD was evaluated by MFC in local laboratories of 60 Hospitals participating in the PETHEMA registry. We also conducted a survey on technical aspects of MRD testing to determine the impact of methodological heterogeneity in the prognostic value of MFC. Our results confirmed the recommended cutoff of 0.1% to discriminate patients with significantly different cumulative-incidence of relapse (-CIR- HR:0.71, P < 0.001) and overall survival (HR: 0.73, P = 0.001), but uncovered the limited prognostic value of MFC based MRD in multivariate and recursive partitioning models including other clinical, genetic and treatment related factors. Virtually all aspects related with methodological, interpretation, and reporting of MFC based MRD testing impacted in its ability to discriminate patients with different CIR. Thus, this study demonstrated that ""real-world"" assessment of MRD using MFC is prognostic in patients at first remission, and urges greater standardization for improved risk-stratification toward clinical decisions in AML.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","2358-2370","","8","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\KRYWWSGJ\Paiva B. et al. - 2021 - Impact of measurable residual disease by decentral.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010321899","adult; aged; article; cumulative incidence; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; human cell; leukemia remission; cancer prognosis; middle aged; leukemia relapse; induction chemotherapy; *minimal residual disease; *acute myeloid leukemia; *flow cytometry; clinical decision making; genetics; hospital laboratory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A better understanding of risk factors for adverse outcomes may improve clinical management in these patients. We therefore studied baseline characteristics of HM patients developing COVID-19 and analyzed predictors of mortality. Method(s): The survey was supported by the Scientific Working Group Infection in Hematology of the European Hematology Association (EHA). Eligible for the analysis were adult patients with HM and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 observed between March and December 2020. Result(s): The study sample includes 3801 cases, represented by lymphoproliferative (mainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 1084, myeloma n = 684 and chronic lymphoid leukemia n = 474) and myeloproliferative malignancies (mainly acute myeloid leukemia n = 497 and myelodysplastic syndromes n = 279). Severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in 63.8% of patients (n = 2425). Overall, 2778 (73.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 689 (18.1%) of whom were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, 1185 patients (31.2%) died. The primary cause of death was COVID-19 in 688 patients (58.1%), HM in 173 patients (14.6%), and a combination of both COVID-19 and progressing HM in 155 patients (13.1%). Highest mortality was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (199/497, 40%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (118/279, 42.3%). The mortality rate significantly decreased between the first COVID-19 wave (March-May 2020) and the second wave (October-December 2020) (581/1427, 40.7% vs. 439/1773, 24.8%, p value < 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis, age, active malignancy, chronic cardiac disease, liver disease, renal impairment, smoking history, and ICU stay correlated with mortality. Acute myeloid leukemia was a higher mortality risk than lymphoproliferative diseases. Conclusion(s): This survey confirms that COVID-19 patients with HM are at high risk of lethal complications. However, improved COVID-19 prevention has reduced mortality despite an increase in the number of reported cases.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:24","2022-09-06 19:01:24","","168","","1","14","","J.

This prospective, observational study was conducted between 2018 and 2020 on newly diagnosed Thai AML or MDS-EB patients aged above 15 years. NGS was performed using a custom amplicon-based targeted enrichment assay for 42 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms. The molecular results were correlated with baseline patient and disease characteristics as well as outcomes. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44-64), with nearly equal proportions of males and females. The median number of mutations was 3 (IQR, 2-4). The most frequent alterations were FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) (28.6%), DNMT3A (24.5%), and WT1 (22.4%) mutations. FLT3-ITD was more frequent in the de novo AML group than in the MDS/secondary AML group, whereas in the MDS/secondary AML group, ASXL1, ETV6, and SRSF2 mutations were more frequent. Patients aged greater than 65 years and patients with mutated TP53 were more likely to have inferior overall survival from multivariate analysis. FLT3-ITD was the most common mutation among newly diagnosed Thai AML patients. TP53 mutation and advanced age were independent adverse factors for survival outcome.

However, due to the high prevalence of LOY as the sole cytogenetic finding in the healthy older population, differentiating isolated LOY associated with clonal hematologic processes from aging-associated mosaicism can be difficult in the absence of definitive morphological features of disease. In the past, various investigators have proposed that a high percentage of metaphases with LOY is more likely to represent expansion of a clonal myeloid disease-associated population. It is unknown whether the proportion of metaphases with LOY is associated with the incidence of myeloid neoplasia-associated genomic alterations. To address this question, we identified bone marrow samples with LOY as an isolated cytogenetic finding and used targeted next generation sequencing-based molecular analysis to identify common myeloid neoplasia-associated somatic mutations. Among 73 patients with a median age of 75 years (range, 29-90), the percentage of metaphases with LOY was <25% in 23 patients, 25-49% in 10, 50-74% in 8 and >=75% in 32. A threshold of >=75% LOY was significantly associated with a morphological diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm (P=0.004). Furthermore, >=75% LOY was associated with a higher lifetime incidence of a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (P<0.0001), and in multivariate analysis >=75% LOY was a statistically significant independent predictor of myeloid neoplasia (odds ratio 6.17; 95% confidence interval: 2.15-17.68; P=0.0007]. Higher LOY percentage (>=75%) was associated with greater likelihood of having somatic mutations (P=0.0009) and a higher number of these mutations (P=0.0002). Our findings indicate that >=75% LOY in bone marrow cells is associated with an increased likelihood of molecular aberrations in genes commonly seen to be altered in myeloid neoplasia and with morphological features of MDS. These observations suggest that >=75% LOY in bone marrow should be considered an MDS-associated cytogenetic aberration.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","555-564","","2","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\Z3ZVSQC7\Ouseph M.M. et al. - 2021 - Genomic alterations in patients with somatic loss .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010982400","adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; incidence; age; myelodysplastic syndrome; *cytogenetics; genetic susceptibility; *gene mutation; DNMT3A gene; high throughput sequencing; TET2 gene; gene; JAK2 gene; RUNX1 gene; STAG2 gene; ASXL1 gene; very elderly; chromosome aberration; *somatic mutation; SETBP1 gene; medical record; *bone marrow cell; *loss of function mutation; *Y chromosome; bone marrow tumor; CBL gene; cblb gene; IDH1 gene; metaphase; mosaicism; PHF6 gene; SF3B11 gene; Sh2b3 gene; U2AF1 gene; World Health Organization; ZRSR2 gene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, excess toxicity to donor lymphocytes may hamper immune reconstitution, compromising antitumor effects and increasing infection. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administered early after HCT may increase ATG-mediated lymphotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an interaction between ATG and post-transplantation granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on allogeneic HCT outcomes, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry. We studied patients age >=18 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received Thymoglobulin-containing preparative regimens for HLA-matched sibling/unrelated or mismatched unrelated donor HCT between 2010 and 2018. The effect of planned G-CSF that was started between pretransplantation day 3 and post-transplantation day 12 was studied in comparison with transplantations that did not include G-CSF. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with outcomes at 1 year after transplantation. A total of 874 patients met the study eligibility criteria, of whom 459 (53%) received planned G-CSF. HCT with planned G-CSF was associated with a significantly increased risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; P <.0001; 21% versus 12%) compared to HCT without G-CSF. The 6-month incidence of viral infection was higher with G-CSF (56% versus 47%; P = .007), with a particular increase in Epstein-Barr virus infections (19% versus 11%; P = .002). The observed higher NRM with planned G-CSF led to lower overall survival (HR, 1.52; P = .0005; 61% versus 72%). There was no difference in GVHD risk between the treatment groups. We performed 2 subgroup analyses showing that our findings held true in patients age >=50 years and in centers where G-CSF was used in some, but not all, patients. In allogeneic peripheral blood HCT performed with Thymoglobulin for AML and MDS, G-CSF administered early post-transplantation resulted in a 2-fold increase in NRM and a 10% absolute decrement in survival. The use of planned G-CSF in the early post-transplantation period should be carefully considered on an individual patient basis, weighing any perceived benefits against these risks.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","993.e1-993.e8","","12","27","","Transplant.

We conducted an MRD correlative study of the EMN02/HO95 MM phase III trial in newly diagnosed MM patients achieving a suspected complete response before maintenance and every 6 months during maintenance. Patients received high-dose melphalan (HDM) versus bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) intensification, followed by bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRd) versus no consolidation, and lenalidomide maintenance. Bone marrow (BM) samples were processed in three European laboratories, applying EuroFlow-based MFC protocols (eight colors, two tubes) with 10-4-10-5 sensitivity. At enrollment in the MRD correlative study, 76% (244/321) of patients were MRD-negative. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after a median follow-up of 75 months, 5-year progression-free survival was 66% in MRD-negative versus 31% in MRD-positive patients (HR 0.39; p < 0.001), 5-year overall survival was 86% versus 69%, respectively (HR 0.41; p < 0.001). MRD negativity was associated with reduced risk of progression or death in all subgroups, including ISS-III (HR 0.37) and high-risk fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patients (HR 0.38;). In the 1-year maintenance MRD population, 42% of MRD-positive patients at pre-maintenance became MRD-negative after lenalidomide exposure. In conclusion, MRD by MFC is a strong prognostic factor. Lenalidomide maintenance further improved MRD-negativity rate.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","106","","6","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature FACSCanto II, Infinicyt 1.7, Kaluza: Beckman Coulter [United States], v3.5.1","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\8F5L9FHP\Oliva S. et al. - 2021 - Minimal residual disease assessment by multiparame.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012311118","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; human cell; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; middle aged; melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy]; follow up; cancer mortality; treatment response; cancer patient; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; melphalan/cb [Drug Combination]; melphalan/cm [Drug Comparison]; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); *multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy]; bortezomib/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer diagnosis; drug megadose; cancer growth; high risk patient; cancer staging; multiple cycle treatment; autologous stem cell transplantation; fluorescence in situ hybridization; lenalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; maintenance therapy; clinical feature; bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; International Staging System; *flow cytometry; disease assessment; prediction; prednisone/dt [Drug Therapy]; lenalidomide/cb [Drug Combination]; prednisone/cb [Drug Combination]; bone marrow; data analysis software; risk reduction; clinical protocol; sensitivity analysis; drug exposure; cancer epidemiology; limit of detection; flow cytometer; intention to treat analysis; correlation analysis; study design; *minimal residual disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; bortezomib/cm [Drug Comparison]; FACSCanto II; information processing device; prednisone/cm [Drug Comparison]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To clarify the impact of MRD for both CR1 and CR2, we analyzed data from a registry database including 1625 adult patients with Ph1 ALL who underwent first allo-HCT during either CR1 or CR2 between 2002 and 2017. Adjusted overall and leukemia-free survival rates at 4 years were 71% and 64%, respectively, for patients undergoing allo-HCT during CR1 with MRD2, 55% and 43% during CR1 with MRD1, 51% and 49% during CR2 with MRD2, and 38% and 29% during CR2 with MRD1. Although survival rates were significantly better among patients with CR1 MRD2 than among patients with CR2 MRD2, no significant difference was observed in survival rate between patients with CR1 MRD1 and CR2 MRD2. Relapse rates after 4 years were 16% in patients with CR1 MRD2, 29% in CR1 MRD1, 21% in patients with CR2 MRD2, and 46% in patients with CR2 MRD1. No significant difference was identified in relapse rate between patients with CR1 MRD2 and CR2 MRD2.

The aim of this study was to evaluate relapse protection following early CMV reactivation after HSCT in the context of the recipient HLA-C killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands (KIRLs). In this retrospective bicentric study, 406 matched related or unrelated donor transplantations for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were stratified by HLA-C KIRL group (homozygous versus heterozygous) and analyzed separately for the impact of early CMVR on the cumulative incidences of relapse, NRM, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) using landmark and multistate analyses. By landmark analysis of patients alive and relapse-free at 45 days post-HSCT, HLA-C KIRL homozygous recipients (C1/1 or C2/2) had a lower risk of subsequent relapse if CMVR occurred before this landmark (subhazard ratio [sHR], 0.36; P = .002). In contrast, in HLA-C KIRL heterozygous (C1/2) recipients, early CMVR had no impact on subsequent relapse (sHR, 0.88; P = .63). NRM (sHR, 3.31; P < .001) and grade III-IV acute GVHD (sHR, 2.60; P = .04) were significantly increased after early CMVR in the homozygous cohort, but not in the heterozygous cohort (NRM: sHR, 1.23; P = .53; grade III-IV acute GVHD: sHR, 1.40; P = .50). Multivariable landmark analyses and a multistate model confirmed the limitation of the relapse-protective effect of early CMVR to the homozygous cohort. Chronic GVHD and overall survival were not influenced in neither cohort. An antileukemic effect of early CMVR after HSCT for AML/MDS was significant but strictly limited to recipients homozygous for HLA-C KIRL. However, particularly in this cohort, CMVR had an adverse impact on aGVHD and NRM.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","686.e1-686.e9","","8","27","","Transplant.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate HRQoL in patients with rehabilitation needs living their everyday life. Patients with MM in remission attended a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation program including a 5-day residential course, home-based exercise and a 2-day follow-up course. The patients were referred by the treating haematologist and completed a booklet of validated HRQoL questionnaires at baseline and before arriving for the 2-day follow-up course. The proportion of participants with moderate to severe symptoms and functional problems were assessed at the two time points and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate explaining factors of impaired HRQoL at baseline. Ninety-two patients participated with a follow-up compliance rate of 90%. Median age was 67 years and median time since diagnosis was 26 months (ranged 5 months to 15.6 years). The most frequently reported symptoms were global quality of life, role functioning, fatigue, pain, peripheral neuropathy and physical functioning. Pain and fatigue were both highly coherent with impairment in physical functioning and those two symptoms explained most HRQoL impairments. Overall, the participants reported no change in HRQoL after the 12-week rehabilitation program.

Monitoring molecular response to therapy by real-time polymerase chain reaction at defined milestones is necessary for early detection of treatment failure. However, this assay is not routinely performed in Tanzania; therefore, the depth of molecular response among patients with CML is not known. A total of 158 patients with previously diagnosed CML who received imatinib treatment were recruited from January 2019 and followed up through October 2020 at Ocean Road Cancer Institute. Information was obtained at the time of diagnosis and follow-up. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes to measure the BCR/ABL ratio on the Gene Xpert system for molecular response determination. The median age of the 158 adult patients was 45 years (range, 18-86). By reference to established treatment milestones, only 37 (23.4%) achieved optimal molecular response. Signs of advanced-stage disease, in particular the need for red cell transfusions before diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.4; 95% CI, 1.32-9.17) and cytopenias (AOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.03-4.96) necessitating drug interruptions were statistically validated predictors of treatment failure on multivariate, multinomial logistic regression. Patient survival at the 22-month follow-up was lowest, with 78.6% (95% CI, 69.4-85.4) in the failure-to-respond category and highest in patients achieving optimal response 97.0% (95% CI, 80.9-99.6). In summary, the majority of patients with CML treated with imatinib in Tanzania do not obtain deep molecular response. This outcome can be attributed to late diagnosis, the development of cytopenias requiring multiple drug interruptions, and poor adherence to treatment.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","1403-1411","","5","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\9S765LG4\Nasser A. et al. - 2021 - Molecular response to imatinib in patients with ch.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011277530","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; human cell; cancer survival; priority journal; follow up; treatment outcome; *chronic myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *imatinib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *imatinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer staging; anemia/si [Side Effect]; fever/si [Side Effect]; neutropenia/si [Side Effect]; thrombocytopenia/si [Side Effect]; prediction; gastrointestinal disease/si [Side Effect]; cytopenia/si [Side Effect]; blood sampling; rash/si [Side Effect]; edetic acid; bleeding/si [Side Effect]; *BCR ABL protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *drug response; *imatinib/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *imatinib/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; Bcr Abl gene; edema/si [Side Effect]; erythrocyte transfusion; hypopigmentation/si [Side Effect]; long term care; musculoskeletal pain/si [Side Effect]; patient compliance; Tanzania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined 104 DNMT3A-mutated de novo AML patients from 2 major centers. Most (82%) had normal karyotype (NK); R882H variants were frequent(38%). The most commonly comutated genes included nucleophosmin (NPM1; 53%), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (25%), IDH1 (23%), IDH2 (23%), and TET2 (21%). Patients with high DNMT3A VAF at diagnosis (>=44%; DNMT3AHIGH) had more significant leukocytosis and higher blast counts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. DNMT3AHIGH cases were associated with much shorter event-free survival (EFS; 14.1 vs 56.8 months) and overall survival (OS; 18.3 months vs not reached) compared with cases of patients with low DNMT3A (DNMT3ALOW).

We analyzed relapse-free survival (RFS) in 92 allo-HCT patients who received TKI for >3 months after allo-HCT, and aimed to develop a novel indicator, called as current TKI- & relapse-free (cTRFree) achievement. TKI after allo-HCT was started as planned in 39 patients, based on measurable residual disease (MRD) in 53 at a median of 152 days after allo-HCT. There was no difference in post-TKI RFS between the planned and MRD-based starting groups (P = 0.69). Second-generation TKIs were associated with superior RFS in Ph-positive acute leukemia (HR 2.71, P = 0.031). TKI was stopped before relapse in 48 patients. Stopping TKI as a time-dependent covariate was not associated with subsequent hematological relapse (HR 1.18, P = 0.72). In the TKI-stop group, TKI administration for >6 months tended to be associated with superior RFS (HR = 0.30, P = 0.08). As an indicator of transplant success, cTRFree was 35% 5 years after starting TKI. TKI could be stopped for recipients with sustained undetectable MRD. However, further prospective studies will be required to establish clinical recommendations.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","1402-1412","","6","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\H5448YYD\Nakasone H. et al. - 2021 - Stopping tyrosine kinase inhibitors started after .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010141832","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; article; cohort analysis; female; graft recipient; human; major clinical study; male; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; adolescent; cancer recurrence; busulfan/dt [Drug Therapy]; melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy]; whole body radiation; busulfan/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; dasatinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; imatinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; risk factor; clinical assessment; *acute leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *acute leukemia/th [Therapy]; *Philadelphia chromosome positive cell; radiation dose; *protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]; health survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, we performed a multicentred retrospective cohort study including a total of 663 adult ALL patients transplanted at non-CR status; the median bone marrow (BM) blast counts at HSCT was 13.2%, and 203 patients (30.6%) were treated at primary induction failure status. The overall survival (OS) was 31.1% at two years, and the multivariate analyses identified five prognostic risk factors, including older age (>=50 years), increased BM blasts (>=10%), poor performance status, high haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)-comorbidity index, and relapsed disease status, among which BM blast was the most significantly related. A predictive scoring system composed of these risk factors clearly stratified OS (15.6-59.5% at two years). In conclusion, this is the first large-scale study to analyze the correlation of patient characteristics with post-transplant prognosis in ALL transplanted at non-CR status.

We recently showed that the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is specifically and consistently overexpressed in ATLL cells, and functions as a novel cell surface marker. In this study, we first show that a soluble form of CADM1 (sCADM1) is secreted from ATLL cells by mainly alternative splicing. After developing the Alpha linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) for sCADM1, we show that plasma sCADM1 concentrations gradually increased during disease progression from indolent to aggressive ATLL. Although other known biomarkers of tumor burden such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2Ralpha) also increased with sCADM1 during ATLL progression, multivariate statistical analysis of biomarkers revealed that only plasma sCADM1 was selected as a specific biomarker for aggressive ATLL, suggesting that plasma sCADM1 may be a potential risk factor for aggressive ATLL. In addition, plasma sCADM1 is a useful marker for monitoring response to chemotherapy as well as for predicting relapse of ATLL. Furthermore, the change in sCADM1 concentration between indolent and aggressive type ATLL was more prominent than the change in the percentage of CD4+CADM1+ ATLL cells. As plasma sCADM1 values fell within normal ranges in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients with higher levels of serum sIL-2Ralpha, the measurement of sCADM1 may become a useful tool to discriminate between ATLL and other inflammatory diseases, including HAM/TSP.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:25","2022-09-06 19:01:25","","532-542","","2","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\2E3YAM6L\Nakahata S. et al. - 2021 - Clinical significance of soluble CADM1 as a novel .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010982398","article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; human cell; cancer recurrence; human tissue; risk factor; cancer chemotherapy; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer growth; gene mutation; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; diagnostic test accuracy study; CD4+ T lymphocyte; tumor volume; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; chimeric antigen receptor; *cell adhesion molecule 1; *T cell leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; *T cell lymphoma/di [Diagnosis]; area under the curve; biological marker; cancer size; CD4 antigen; cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell line; density gradient centrifugation; human T cell leukemia virus; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; HuT 78 cell line; immunoadsorption; inflammatory disease; interleukin 2; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 23; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; peripheral blood mononuclear cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed prognostic gene mutations by targeted next-generation sequencing to identify predisposing factors for predicting OS at 1 month before transplantation. We enrolled 120 patients with nonremission AML who underwent first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2018. Mutations were found in 98 patients; frequently mutated genes were FLT3-ITD, TP53, RUNX1, and WT1. TP53 mutation was detected in 21 patients and was the only predictor of poor OS. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression hazard model revealed primary AML, monosomal karyotype (MK), and TP53 mutation as independent factors for predicting poor OS. Based on these, patients were stratified into three groups. The low-risk group included patients with prior myeloid disorder without MK (n = 26). Among the rest, patients with TP53 mutation were assigned to the high-risk group (n = 19) and the rest into the intermediate-risk group (n = 75). Two-year OS in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups differed significantly (50.0%, 24.9%, and 0%, respectively).

We have recently reported that outcomes of adult patients (pts) with ALL in complete remission (CR) receiving HaploSCT are comparable to unrelated donor transplants. We now compared HaploSCT and matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants in pts with ALL. Aim(s): To assess transplantation outcomes of HaploSCT and MSD transplants in pts with ALL in CR. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed adult patients (>= 18 years) with ALL who underwent their first allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in first or second CR between 2012 and 2018, either from a T cell replete Haplo or MSD donor, and whose data were reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Multivariate analysis (MVA) adjusting for differences between the groups was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Propensity score matching was also performed to reduce confounding effects. Result(s): The analysis comprised 2304 patients: HaploSCT-413; MSD-1891. Median follow-up was 25 months. Median age was 37 (range 18-75) and 38 (18-76) years in HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. HaploSCT patients were transplanted more recently than those transplanted from MSD (2016 vs 2015, p < 0.0001). A higher rate of HaploSCT was in CR2 (33.4% vs 16.7%, p < 0.0001), respectively, and fewer received myeloablative conditioning (68% vs 83.2%, p < 0.0001). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity was lower in HaploSCT patients (22% vs 28%, p = 0.01) and donors (27.1% vs 33%, p < 0.02), and a higher proportion of the HaploSCTs were performed using a bone marrow (BM) graft (46.2% vs 18.6%, p < 0.0001). The 2 groups did not differ with regard to gender, Karnofsky performance status score, ALL phenotype, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positivity and pre-alloSCT measurable residual disease (MRD). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was mainly post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) based (92.7%) in the HaploSCT setting, while it was mostly pharmacologic in the setting of MSD (18.7% received ATG). Cumulative incidence of engraftment at day 60 was higher in MSD transplants compared to HaploSCT (98.7% vs 96.3%, p = 0.001), respectively. Day 180 incidence of acute (a) GVHD II-IV and III-IV was higher in HaploSCT vs. MSD: 36.3% vs 28.9% (p = 0.002 and 15.2% vs 10.5% (p = 0.005), respectively. Conversely, the 2-year chronic (c) GVHD and extensive cGVHD were 32% vs 38.8% (p = 0.009) and 11.9% vs 19.5% (p = 0.001) in HaploSCT vs MSD, respectively. Main causes of death were leukemia (31.8% vs 45%), infection (33.1% vs 19.7%) and GVHD (16.6% vs 19.7%) for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. Two-year relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 26% vs 31.6%, 22.9% vs 13%, 51% vs 55.4%, 58.8% vs 67.4% and 40.6% vs 39% for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. In the MVA, RI was significantly lower in HaploSCT in comparison with MSD, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66 (95% CI 0.52-0.83, p = 0.004), while NRM was significantly higher, HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.43-2.53, p < 0.0001). aGVHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV were higher in HaploSCT than in MSD HR = 1.53 (95% CI 1.23-1.9, p = 0.0002) and HR = 1.54 (95% CI 1.1-2.15, p = 0.011), respectively. Extensive cGVHD was lower in HaploSCT compared with MSD, HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.43-0.88, p = 0.007), while total cGVHD did not differ significantly, HR = 0.94 (95% CI 0.74-1.18, p = 0.58).

Within a large international prospective cohort, we evaluated clinical outcomes in these 3 populations. We conducted a secondary analysis of the EFRAIM study, a multicenter observational study of immunocompromised adults with ARF admitted to 62 intensive care units (ICUs) in 16 countries. We described characteristics and compared outcomes of patients with HM who did not undergo transplantation and patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HCT using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score-matched analyses. A total of 801 patients were included: 570 who did not undergo transplantation, 86 autologous HCT recipients and 145 allogeneic HCT recipients. Acute myelogenous leukemia (171 of 570; 30%) was the most common HM and most common indication for allogeneic HCT (76 of 145; 52%). Compared with the patients who did not undergo HCT and autologous HCT recipients, allogeneic HCT recipients were younger, had fewer comorbid conditions, and were more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy in the ICU. Unadjusted ICU and hospital mortality were 35% and 45%, respectively, across the entire cohort. In multivariable regression analysis, autologous HCT (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], .57 to 2.03; P = .82) and allogeneic HCT (OR, .99; 95% CI, .60 to 1.66; P = .98) were not associated with higher hospital mortality compared with the no-HCT cohort, adjusting for demographic, functional, clinical, malignancy, and ARF characteristics. The results were similar when analyzed using propensity score-matching techniques. Our findings indicate that autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients who develop ARF and require ICU admission have similar hospital mortality as patients with HM not treated with HCT.

Although the incidence of viral infections in HLA-haploidentical HCT recipients who receive post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is reportedly increased, there are insufficient data describing the incidence of CRVIs and the impact of donor source and PTCy on transplant outcomes. Analysing patients receiving their first HCT between 2012 and 2017 for acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, we describe comparative outcomes between matched sibling transplants receiving either calcineurin-based GVHD prophylaxis (SibCNI, N = 1605) or PTCy (SibCy, N = 403), and related haploidentical transplants receiving PTCy (HaploCy, N = 757). The incidence of CRVIs was higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor type. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRVI by day +180 had both a higher risk of treatment-related mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 214, 99% confidence interval (CI) 113-407; P = 0002] and inferior 2-year overall survival (HR 165, 99% CI 111-243; P = 0001) compared to SibCNI with no CRVI. This finding justifies further research into long-term antiviral immune recovery, as well as development of preventive and treatment strategies to improve long-term outcomes in such patients.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:26","2022-09-06 19:01:26","","145-157","","1","194","","Br.

SMN were reported by the treating institutions and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. After a median follow-up of 9.4 years (quartile [Q] range, Q1 6.7 and Q3 12.1) 95 SMN were registered (26 carcinomas including nine basal cell carcinomas, 21 acute myeloid leukemias/myelodysplastic syndromes, 20 lymphoid malignancies, 12 central nervous system [CNS]-tumors, and 16 others). Cumulative incidence at 20 years was 5.7+/-0.7%, standard incidence ratio, excluding basal cell carcinomas, was 19.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 14.5-26.5). Median time from initial diagnosis to second malignancy was 8.7 years (range, 0.2-30.3 years). Acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-type therapy, cumulative anthracycline dose, and cranial radiotherapy for brain tumor-development were significant risk factors in univariate analysis only. In multivariate analysis including risk factors significant in univariate analysis, female sex (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI: 1.23-2.86, P=0.004), CNS-involvement (HR 2.24, 95% CI: 1.03-4.88, P=0.042), lymphoblastic lymphoma (HR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.69-3.97, P<0.001), and cancer-predisposing condition (HR 11.2, 95% CI: 5.52-22.75, P<0.001) retained an independent risk. Carcinomas were the most frequent SMN after non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood followed by acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoid malignancies. Female sex, lymphoblastic lymphoma, CNS-involvement, or/and known cancer-predisposing condition were risk factors for SMN-development.

Our aim was to establish PS29MRC as a clinically usable assay by using the widely implemented NanoString platform and further validate the classifier in a more recently treated patient cohort. Analyses were performed on 351 patients with newly diagnosed AML intensively treated within the German AML Cooperative Group registry. As a continuous variable, PS29MRC performed best in predicting induction failure in comparison with previously published risk models. The classifier was strongly associated with overall survival. We were able to establish a previously defined cutoff that allows classifier dichotomization (PS29MRCdic). PS29MRCdic significantly identified induction failure with 59% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and 72% overall accuracy (odds ratio, 4.81; P 5 4.15 3 10210). PS29MRCdic was able to improve the European Leukemia Network 2017 (ELN-2017) risk classification within every category. The median overall survival with high PS29MRCdic was 1.8 years compared with 4.3 years for low-risk patients. In multivariate analysis including ELN-2017 and clinical and genetic markers, only age and PS29MRCdic were independent predictors of refractory disease. In patients aged $60 years, only PS29MRCdic remained as a significant variable. In summary, we confirmed PS29MRC as a valuable classifier to identify high-risk patients with AML.

Near-ETP ALL is transcriptionally similar to ETP-ALL but CD5 expression level is not low enough to meet the criteria of ETP immunophenotype. Outcomes of near-ETP ALL are not well characterized. We reviewed 171 patients with newly-diagnosed T-ALL/LBL. Patients were categorized into three groups; ETP (N = 27), near-ETP (N = 24), and non-ETP ALL/LBL (N = 120). ETP-ALL/LBL was associated with a significantly worse survival compared with non-ETP ALL/LBL: 5-year overall survival (OS) rates 32% versus 63% (p <.001). Outcome was similar between near-ETP and non-ETP ALL/LBL: 5-year OS rates 56% versus 63% (p =.543). Landmark analysis showed that allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in first remission was beneficial in ETP-ALL/LBL (5-year event-free survival rates 36% versus 18%, p =.030) but not in near-ETP or non-ETP ALL/LBL. Multivariate analysis selected the following as significant independent prognostic factors for OS: age >= 60 years (HR 3.11; p =.003); elevated WBC >=100 x 109/L (HR 2.60; p =.005); and ETP immunophenotype (HR 2.29; p =.010). A survival advantage with adding nelarabine to hyper-CVAD was observed in non-ETP ALL (5-year OS rates 83% versus 38% with hyper-CVAD plus neralabine versus hyper-CVAD, p =.003). In conclusion, outcome of ETP-ALL/LBL was poor and improved with allo-SCT; outcome of near-ETP ALL/LBL was similar to non-ETP ALL/LBL; the addition of nelarabine to hyper-CVAD improved the survival in non-ETP ALL only.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:26","2022-09-06 19:01:26","","589-598","","5","96","","Am.

Using data from a Japanese registry, we retrospectively analyzed 4392 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who received transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors to investigate the effects of HLAs on acute GVHD. From unbiased searches of HLA-A, -B, and -DR, HLA-B60 was significantly associated with an increased risk of grades II-IV acute GVHD (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.59; P = 0.001). In contrast, HLA-B62 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of grades II-IV (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.87; P < 0.001) and III-IV acute GVHD (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87; P = 0.005). The risk of leukemia relapse was significantly higher in HLA-B62-positive patients than in HLA-B62-negative patients (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43; P = 0.01). Both HLA-B60 and -B62 did not affect overall survival. The findings of this study may by implication suggest the possibility that the effects of specific HLAs on transplant outcomes may reflect inherent biological features, and thus consideration of specific HLAs may be helpful to predict transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:26","2022-09-06 19:01:26","","646-654","","3","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\S5CWGRWT\Morishima S. et al. - 2021 - Individual HLAs influence immunological events in .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexb&NEWS=N&AN=2006921140","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; controlled study; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; tacrolimus/dt [Drug Therapy]; *HLA matching; acute graft versus host disease/co [Complication]; acute graft versus host disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; acute graft versus host disease/pc [Prevention]; adolescent; child; infant; cancer recurrence; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; unclassified drug; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; multivariate analysis; clinical outcome; risk factor; tacrolimus/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; disease severity; hazard ratio; Japanese (people); predictive value; confidence interval; patient registry; correlation analysis; *matched sibling donor; leukemia/th [Therapy]; *HLA A antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *HLA B antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *HLA B60 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *HLA B62 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *HLA DR antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *immune response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, prognostic models and comorbidity indices are important tools to estimate survival and to guide clinicians in individualising treatment. In this nationwide population-based study, we assess comorbidities and for the first time validate comorbidity indices in CMML. We also compare the prognostic power of: the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS), MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System (MDAPS) and Mayo score. In this cohort of 337 patients with CMML, diagnosed between 2009 and 2015, the median overall survival was 21.3 months. Autoimmune conditions were present in 25% of the patients, with polymyalgia rheumatica and Hashimoto's thyroiditis being most common. Of the tested comorbidity indices: the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Specific Comorbidity Index (MDS-CI), CCI had the highest C-index (0.62) and was the only comorbidity index independently associated with survival in multivariable analyses. When comparing the prognostic power of the scoring systems, the CPSS had the highest C-index (0.69). In conclusion, using 'real-world' data we found that the CCI and CPSS have the best prognostic power and that autoimmune conditions are overrepresented in CMML.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

FCM-MRD performed in 18 laboratories across seven countries was used for risk stratification of 1487 patients with BCP-ALL enrolled in the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. When no informative FCM-marker was available, risk stratification was based on real-time quantitative PCR. An informative FCM-marker was found in 96.2% and only two patients (0.14%) had non-informative FCM and non-informative PCR-markers. The overall 5-year event-free survival was 86.1% with a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR5y) of 9.5%. FCM-MRD levels on days 15 (HzR 4.0, p < 0.0001), 29 (HzR 2.7, p < 0.0001), and 79 (HzR 3.5, p < 0.0001) associated with hazard of relapse adjusted for age, cytogenetics, and WBC. The early (day 15) response associated with CIR5y adjusted for day 29 FCM-MRD, with higher levels in adults (median 2.4 x 10-2 versus 5.2 x 10-3, p < 0.0001). Undetectable FCM- and/or PCR-MRD on day 29 identified patients with a very good outcome (CIR5y = 3.2%). For patients who did not undergo transplantation, day 79 FCM-MRD > 10-4 associated with a CIR5y = 22.1%.

We retrospectively compared outcomes of 76 adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent 7/8 HLA-MMUD transplantation and received either PTcy (50 mg/kg on day 3 and 4) or thymoglobulin (total dose 4.5 mg/kg) for GVHD prophylaxis. In addition, tacrolimus and mycophenolate were used in both groups. Propensity score-based multivariable analyses (PSCA) were performed to adjust confounding effects of patient characteristics between both groups. Between January 2006 and June 2019, 25 patients received PTcy, and 51 received thymoglobulin. Median age of the population was 57 years, 78% of patients had AML, most common graft source was peripheral blood (96%), and 46% received myeloablative conditioning regimens. Median time to neutrophil (15 versus 11 days, P <.001) and platelet engraftment (21 versus 15 days, P =.002) was prolonged in the PTcy group. The cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD at day 100 was similar (12% versus 19.6%, P =.38), whereas chronic GVHD at 1 year was lower with PTcy compared to thymoglobulin (16% versus 49%, P =.006). Using PSCA, no difference in survival, relapse, relapse-free survival, and GVHD-free relapse-free survival was seen between groups. However, thymoglobulin was associated with higher incidence of acute (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.63, P =.01) and chronic GVHD (HR = 4.43, P =.03), and non-relapse mortality (HR 3.38, P =.04) compared to PTcy.

We hypothesized that addition of 200cGy total body irradiation (TBI) to Flu-Mel140 may improve antitumor activity and transplant outcomes. Primary objectives was overall survival (OS) at 3 years. Secondary objectives were to assess the cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GVHD, relapse-free survival (RFS), relapse rate, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of patients receiving Flu-Mel140-TBI followed by HLA-matched donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) using peripheral blood stem cells. Eighty-one patients (median age, 58 years) underwent alloSCT between January 2008 and December 2018. Thirty-one percent of patients had a prior transplant, 32% had high or very-high disease risk index, and the donor was unrelated in 70% of patients. Grade 3 to 4 regimen-related toxicities were mucositis (37%), cardiac toxicity (17%), and renal toxicity (10%). The cumulative incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD at day +100 was 24.7% and chronic GVHD at 1 year was 51.3%. Median follow-up for survival was 6.1 years. At 3 years, OS was 39.81%, RFS was 31.47%, and relapse rate was 30.5%. One-year NRM was 29.9%. Patients undergoing first transplantation experienced improved OS compared with second or beyond (63.08% versus 42.31%, P = .02). After adjusting for disease subtypes, age (<=55 versus 55), comorbidity index (CI), number of transplant and GVHD prophylaxis, multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any survival difference among disease subtypes. High CI (>=3) was predictive of adverse OS and NRM, whereas older age (>55 years) was associated with high NRM. Our study shows that Flu-Mel140-TBI seems feasible and provides durable disease control. Addition of TBI did not appear to improve outcomes compared to previously published reports of Flu-Mel140. Considerable NRM could result from the inclusion of patients with older age and prior transplants.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:26","2022-09-06 19:01:26","","665.e1-665.e7","","8","27","","Transplant.

Disparity exists in access to HCT among different patient populations and requires further study. In this study, we compared HCT rates for AML among different regions in the state of Virginia and identified geographic and socioeconomic factors associated with the likelihood of receiving HCT. We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of patients 18 to 74 years of age diagnosed with AML in Virginia from 2013 to 2017 as reported to the Virginia Cancer Registry (VCR); the VCR was further linked with the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database for identification of patients who had undergone HCT within 2 years of diagnosis. Socioeconomic data were generated from the VCR and the American Community Survey. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine selected socioeconomic factors of interest, including patient-level information such as sex, age, race, marital status, and primary insurance payer, as well as factors associated with geography, including the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and percentage of African Americans residing in the region. In Virginia, 818 patients were diagnosed with AML from 2013 to 2017, and, of these, 168 patients (21%) underwent HCT within 2 years of diagnosis. Median age was lower in the HCT cohort (55 years) versus the non-HCT cohort (64 years) (P <.001). There was a higher proportion of married patients in the HCT cohort (67%) versus the non-HCT cohort (53%) (P =.005). The rate of HCT varied by geographic region (P =.004). The multivariable analyses (without including SVI) showed decreased likelihood of HCT with increasing age (odds ratio [OR],.96; 95% confidence interval [CI],.95 to.98). Patients from regions that had a greater than 25% African American population were less likely to undergo HCT (OR,.58; 95% CI,.38 to.89). Patients who were not married were less likely to undergo HCT compared with married patients (OR,.56; 95% CI,.36 to.88). Patients with government-sponsored insurance as the primary payer were less likely to undergo HCT compared with patients with private insurance (OR,.49; 95% CI,.32 to.77). Patients living in Zip Code areas with a greater percentage of population with a bachelor's or graduate degree were more likely to undergo HCT (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03). In a separate multivariate model with SVI, patients residing in a Zip Code with higher SVI were less likely to undergo HCT (OR,.37; 95% CI,.16 to.82). From 2013 to 2017, we found that the likelihood of a patient undergoing HCT in Virginia for AML within 2 years of diagnosis was negatively associated with increasing age, percent of African Americans residing in the region, not-married relationship status, government-sponsored insurance as primary payer, higher SVI, and decreased percent of population with a bachelor's or graduate degree. Resources should be directed toward at-risk patient populations to remove barriers to improve access to HCT. The SVI can be used to identify communities at risk nationwide.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:26","2022-09-06 19:01:26","","869.e1-869.e9","","10","27","","Transplant.

Outcomes of Ph+ AML (n = 30), intermediate-risk, and poor-risk AML patients were compared. The 3-year overall survival after allo-HCT was similar in intermediate-risk (62.7%; 95% CI: 61.0-64.3%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.42); however, it differed significantly between the poor-risk (49.7%; 95% CI: 45.9-53.4%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.049). Disease-free survival in Ph+ AML patients was comparable to that in intermediate-risk patients but better than that in poor-risk patients. Relapse rates were significantly lower in Ph+ AML patients than in other groups. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were similar among groups. Multivariate analysis showed that Ph+ AML was not a significant predictor of poor prognosis in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and NRM. Our data showed better post-transplant outcomes for Ph+ AML patients than for those with poor-risk AML. Hence, allo-HCT could be a feasible treatment option for Ph+ AML patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","232-242","","1","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\2AWMID5W\Mizuno S. et al. - 2021 - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation effi.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2005734281","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; outcome assessment; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; priority journal; survival rate; cancer mortality; risk factor; cancer regression; survival time; disease free survival; *allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation; *cell transplantation; *Philadelphia 1 chromosome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the ability of multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect DIKZF1 and to determine the impact on event-free survival of patients with precursor B-ALL aged 23 to 65 years recruited to the completed trial UKALL14 (ISRCTN 66541317). From 655 recruits with BCR-ABL11 and BCRABL12 B-ALL, all available diagnostic DNA samples (76% of the recruited population) were screened by multiplex end point PCR covering 4 deletions: dominant-negative (DN) D4-7 or the loss of function D2-7, D4-8, and D2-8 (n 5 498), MLPA (n 5 436), or by both (n 5 420). Although patients with BCR-ABL12 DIKZF1 were more likely to have minimal residual disease at the end of induction, we did not find any impact of DIKZF1 (including subgroup analysis for DN or loss-of-function lesions) or the IKZF1plus genotype on event-free, overall survival, or relapse risk by univariable or multivariable analyses. Consistent with the technical approach, MLPA not only detected a wider range of deletions than PCR but also failed to detect some PCR-detected lesions. The main difference between our study and others reporting an association between DIKZF1 and outcome is the older age of participants in our population. The impact of DIKZF1 in ALL may be less marked in an older population of patients. Our study underscores the need for analyses in large, harmonized data sets.

The aim of this study was to report the cases of legionellosis and to identify predictors of legionellosis, legionellosis-associated death, and non-relapse mortality (NRM). All cases of post-HSCT legionellosis from the EBMT registry were included and matched with controls in a 3:1 ratio for the analyses of risk factors. In the years 1995-2016, 80 cases from 52 centers in 14 countries were identified (mainly from France, Italy, and Spain). Median time from HSCT to legionellosis was 203 days (range, 0-4099); 19 (23.8%) patients developed early legionellosis (within-day +30 post-HSCT). Patients were mainly male (70%), after allogeneic HSCT (70%), with acute leukemia (27.5%), lymphoma (23.8%), or multiple myeloma (21.3%), and the median age of 46.6 (range, 7.2-68.2). Predictors of legionellosis were allogeneic HSCT (OR = 2.27, 95%CI:1.08-4.80, p = 0.03) and recent other infection (OR = 2.96, 95%CI:1.34-6.52, p = 0.007). Twenty-seven (33.8%) patients died due to legionellosis (44% after early legionellosis), NRM was 50%.

As CAR T-cell therapy continues to evolve, infection risks and management thereof will become increasingly important to optimize outcomes across the spectrum of antigens and disease targeted. We retrospectively characterized infectious complications occurring in 162 children and adults treated among 5 phase 1 CAR T-cell clinical trials. Trials included targeting of CD19, CD22, disialoganglioside (GD2) or B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Fifty-three patients (32.7%) had 76 infections between lymphocyte depleting (LD) chemotherapy and day 30 (D30); with the majority of infections (61, 80.3%) occurring between day 0 (D0) and D30. By trial, the highest proportion of infections was seen with CD22 CAR T cells (n 5 23/53; 43.4%), followed by BCMA CAR T cells (n 5 9/24; 37.5%). By disease, patients with multiple myeloma had the highest proportion of infections (9/24; 37.5%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36/102; 35.3%). Grade 4 infections were rare (n 5 4; 2.5%). Between D0 and D30, bacteremia and bacterial site infections were the most common infection type. In univariate analysis, increasing prior lines of therapy, recent infection within 100 days of LD chemotherapy, corticosteroid or tocilizumab use, and fever and neutropenia were associated with a higher risk of infection. In a multivariable analysis, only prior lines of therapy and recent infection were associated with higher risk of infection. In conclusion, we provide a broad overview of infection risk within the first 30 days post infusion across a host of multiple targets and diseases, elucidating both unique characteristics and commonalities highlighting aspects important to improving patient outcomes.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

We aimed to investigate the potential underlying effect of Down syndrome versus the effects of adverse cancer genetics on clinical outcome. Method(s): Patients (aged 1-23 years) with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls) from eight trials (DCOG ALL10 and ALL11, ANZCHOG ALL8, AIEOP-BFM ALL2009, UKALL2003, NOPHO ALL2008, CoALL 07-03, and CoALL 08-09) done between 2002 and 2018 across various countries (the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Germany) were included. Participants were matched (1:3) for clinical risk factors and genetics, including IKZF1 deletion. The primary endpoint was the comparison of MRD levels (absolute MRD levels were categorised into two groups, low [<0.0001] and high [>=0.0001]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls, and the secondary outcomes were comparison of long-term outcomes (event-free survival, overall survival, relapse, and treatment-related mortality [TRM]) between patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and matched controls. Two matched cohorts were formed: for MRD analyses and for long-term outcome analyses. For both cohorts, matching was based on induction regimen; for the long-term outcome cohort, matching also included MRD-guided treatment group. We used mixed-effect models, Cox models, and competing risk for statistical analyses. Finding(s): Of 251 children and adolescents with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 136 were eligible for analyses and matched to 407 (of 8426) non-Down syndrome patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (matched controls). 113 patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia were excluded from matching in accordance with predefined rules, no match was available for two patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The proportion of patients with high MRD at the end of induction treatment was similar for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (52 [38%] of 136) and matched controls (157 [39%] of 403; OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.64-1.46]; p=0.88). Patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia had a higher relapse risk than did matched controls in the IKZF1 deleted group (relapse at 5 years 37.1% [17.1-57.2] vs 13.2% [6.1-23.1]; cause-specific hazard ratio [HRcs] 4.3 [1.6-11.0]; p=0.0028), but not in the IKZF1 wild-type group (relapse at 5 years 5.8% [2.1-12.2] vs 8.1% [5.1-12.0]; HRcs 1.0 [0.5-2.1]; p=0.99). In addition to increased induction deaths (15 [6%] of 251 vs 69 [0.8%] of 8426), Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia was associated with a higher risk of post-induction TRM compared with matched controls (TRM at 5 years 12.2% [7.0-18.9] vs 2.7% [1.3-4.9]; HRcs 5.0 [2.3-10.8]; p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Induction treatment is equivalently effective for patients with Down syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and for matched patients without Down syndrome. Down syndrome itself provides an additional risk in individuals with IKZF1 deletions, suggesting an interplay between the germline environment and this poor risk somatic aberration. Different treatment strategies are warranted considering both inherent risk of relapse and high risk of TRM.

The rate of renal failure and associated risk factors remains unknown in real-world populations. Adults with relapsed/refractory MM who received carfilzomib between the years 2013 and 2016 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked databases. Renal failure was defined using the corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes and procedure codes for dialysis. Patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of renal failure were excluded to distinguish an adverse event from comorbidity. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify the variables independently associated with the development of renal failure among MM patients utilizing carfilzomib. A total of 1950 patients were included in the analysis. Renal failure developed in 22% of patients during the study period. The median time to development of renal failure from first carfilzomib administration was 1.6 months (range < 0.1-23.3). Increasing age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.01 per year, p = 0.018), pre-existing heart failure (aHR 1.50, p = 0.005), and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (aHR 2.00, p < 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of developing renal failure. Renal failure occurred in up to 22% of patients on carfilzomib therapy. The exact cause and mechanism of renal failure cannot be determined from our study and may be multifactorial. Future studies are needed to further understand the cause of renal failure among patients on carfilzomib and devise strategies to mitigate the risk.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","1261-1266","","5","100","","Ann.

An earlier Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) analysis of 868 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCTs) performed between 1990 and 2004 showed a 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 22% and 21%, respectively. Modern supportive care, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have led to improved outcomes. Therefore, the CIBMTR analyzed 1531 allo-HCTs performed in adults with t-MDS (n = 759) or t-AML (n = 772) between and 2000 and 2014. The median age was 59 years (range, 18 to 74 years) for the patients with t-MDS and 52 years (range, 18 to 77 years) for those with t-AML. Twenty-four percent of patients with t-MDS and 11% of those with t-AML had undergone a previous autologous (auto-) HCT. A myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen was used in 49% of patients with t-MDS and 61% of patients with t-AML. Nonrelapse mortality at 5 years was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30% to 37%) for patients with t-MDS and 34% (95% CI, 30% to 37%) for those with t-AML. Relapse rates at 5 years in the 2 groups were 46% (95% CI, 43% to 50%) and 43% (95% CI, 40% to 47%). Five-year OS and DFS were 27% (95% CI, 23% to 31%) and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%), respectively, for patients with t-MDS and 25% (95% CI, 22% to 28%) and 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%), respectively, for those with t-AML. In multivariate analysis, OS and DFS were significantly better in young patients with low-risk t-MDS and those with t-AML undergoing HCT with MAC while in first complete remission, but worse for those with previous auto-HCT, higher-risk cytogenetics or Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and a partially matched unrelated donor. Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure, with little improvement seen over the past 2 decades. These data mandate caution when recommending allo-HCT in these conditions and indicate the need for more effective antineoplastic approaches before and after allo-HCT.Copyright © 2021","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","923.e1-923.e12","","11","27","","Transplant.

We compared outcomes of HCT in BM graft and PB graft recipients age >=18 years with hematologic malignancies who underwent T cell- replete haploidentical HCT and received graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among the 264 patients, 180 (68%) received a BM graft and 84 (32%) received a PB graft. The median patient age was 50 years in both groups. The majority (n = 199; 75%) received reduced-intensity conditioning. The rate of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was higher in the BM graft recipients compared with the PB graft recipients (85% [n = 152] versus 55% [n = 46]; P < .01). The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and the incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were comparable in the 2 groups. Among the patients with grade II-IV aGVHD, the rate of steroid-refractory aGVHD was 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 18%) in the BM group versus 32% (95% CI, 19% to 54%) in the PB group (hazard ratio [HR], 3.7, 95% CI, 1.5 to 9.3; P = .006). At 1 year post-HCT, the rate of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 8% (95% CI, 4% to 13%) in the BM group versus 22% (95% CI, 14% to 36%) in the PB group (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.6; P = .005), and the rate of systemic therapy-requiring cGVHD was 2.5% (95% CI, 1% to 7%) versus 14% (95% CI, 7% to 27%), respectively (HR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7 to 18; P = .004). The PB group had a significantly higher risk of bacterial and viral infections, with no appreciable advantage in the duration of hospitalization, immune reconstitution, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, or survival.

Severe allergic reactions lead to substitution of further PEG-asparaginase with Erwinia. Erwinia is associated with more frequent dosing, increased expense, and limited availability. Premedication may reduce rates of allergic reactions. Procedures: This Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three strategies: premedication plus therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), TDM alone, and no premedication or TDM. We modeled two scenarios: a standard-risk (SR) B-ALL patient receiving two asparaginase doses and a high-risk (HR) patient receiving seven asparaginase doses. The model incorporated costs of asparaginase, premedication, TDM and clinic visits, and lost parental wages associated with each additional Erwinia dose. We incorporated a five-year time horizon with a societal perspective. Outcomes were Erwinia substitutions avoided and differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses evaluated model uncertainty. Result(s): In both scenarios, premedication was the least costly strategy. In SR and HR scenarios, premedication with monitoring resulted in 8% and 7% fewer changes to Erwinia compared with monitoring alone and 3% and 2% fewer changes compared with no premedication/monitoring, respectively. Premedication resulted in the most QALYs gained in the SR patients. Individual variation of model inputs did not change premedication/monitoring favorability for either scenario. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, premedication/monitoring was favored in >87% of iterations in both scenarios. Conclusion(s): Compared with other strategies, premedication use and asparaginase level monitoring in children with B-ALL is potentially cost-saving.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","e29051","","8","68","","Pediatr.

Adults (aged 18-70 years) who received alloHSCT in first complete remission, had achieved hematologic recovery, and were transfusion independent were randomized to receive SOC with or without midostaurin (50 mg twice daily) continuously in twelve 4-week cycles. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) 18 months post-alloHSCT. Sixty patients were randomized (30/arm); 30 completed all 12 cycles (midostaurin + SOC, n = 16; SOC, n = 14). The estimated 18-month RFS (95% CI) was 89% (69-96%) in the midostaurin arm and 76% (54-88%) in the SOC arm (hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.12-1.86]; P = 0.27); estimated relapse rates were 11% and 24%, respectively. Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation to <70% of baseline (achieved by 50% of midostaurin-treated patients) was associated with improved RFS.

However, response to vaccines has been investigated in a small series of CLL patients. We analyzed the antibody response and outcomes of 112 CLL patients who received the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). An immune response was defined by a twofold increase in the PC-IgG levels assessed by ELISA. The median age of patients was 68 years, 23.2% showed IgG levels <= 400 mg/L, 6.3% progressive disease, 52% unmutated IGHV. Twenty-two (19.6%) patients were treatment-naive and 90 (80.4%) previously treated (40.2% front-line chemoimmunotherapy; ibrutinib first/advanced-line, 9.8%/21.4%; idelalisib advanced-line, 8.9%). Nine (8%) patients developed an immune response, eight treatment-naive, and one on front-line ibrutinib. No responses were observed in patients previously treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Age >= 60 years (p = 0.007), IgG levels < 400 mg/L (p < 0.0001), prior treatment (p < 0.0001), and signs of disease progression (p = 0.04) were associated with a lower response rate. Pneumonia-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with clinical signs of progressive disease (HR, 8.39), prior pneumonia (HR, 7.03), and TP53 disruption (HR, 2.91).

This study aimed to clarify factors associated with in-hospital death in patients with coagulopathy during induction therapy for APL. We retrospectively identified patients with newly diagnosed APL who received induction therapy including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and developed coagulopathy, using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. Of 1115 eligible patients, 175 (15%) died at a median of 13 days (interquartile range, 7-30) after admission. In the multivariable analysis, compared with younger patients (aged < 40 years), the occurrence of in-hospital death was significantly more common among older patients (aged >= 40 and < 60 years: odds ratio = 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.29-5.19]; aged >= 60 and < 80 years: 7.66 [3.89-15.10]; aged >= 80 years: 16.83 [7.41-38.21]). Delayed initiation of ATRA and no conventional chemotherapy were significantly associated with in-hospital death (1.79 [1.16-2.76] and 2.40 [1.47-3.92], respectively). A total of 699 patients (63%) received anticoagulant therapies, but none of these was significantly associated with lower mortality. Although the present study was constrained by a lack of laboratory findings because of database limitations, the results showed that untreated patients with APL, especially the elderly, had a poor prognosis. Immediate administration of ATRA may reduce in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","2613-2619","","10","100","","Ann.

Multiple myeloma (MM) patients show an increased risk for infections and they are expected to be particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we have obtained a comprehensive picture of the impact of COVID-19 in MM patients on a local and a global scale using a federated data research network (TriNetX) that provided access to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from Health Care Organizations (HCO) all over the world. Through propensity score matched analyses we found that the number of new diagnoses of MM was reduced in 2020 compared to 2019 (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.96) and the survival of newly diagnosed MM cases decreased similarly (HR 0.61, 0.38-0.81). MM patients showed higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 2.09, 1.58-2.76) and a higher excess mortality in 2020 (difference in excess mortality 9%, 4.4-13.2) than non-MM patients. By interrogating large EMR datasets from HCO in Europe and globally, we confirmed that MM patients have been more severely impacted by COVID-19 pandemic than non-MM patients. This study highlights the necessity of extending preventive measures worlwide to protect vulnerable patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting social distancing and an intensive vaccination strategies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","198","","12","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\RNSP6DVW\Martinez-Lopez J. et al. - 2021 - Impact of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myelo.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2014631069","aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; Europe; mortality; *coronavirus disease 2019; *multiple myeloma; electronic medical record; propensity score; health care organization; excess mortality; social distancing; vaccination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied 153 patients with MDS and del(20q) to assess the incidence, prognostic value and impact on response to azacitidine (AZA) of ASXL1 chromosomal alterations and genetic mutations. Additionally, in vitro assay of the response to AZA in HAP1 (HAP1WT) and HAP1 ASXL1 knockout (HAP1KN) cells was performed. ASXL1 chromosomal alterations were detected in 44 patients (28.5%): 34 patients (22%) with a gene deletion (ASXL1DEL) and 10 patients (6.5%) with additional gene copies. ASXL1DEL was associated with a lower platelet count. The most frequently mutated genes were U2AF1 (16%), ASXL1 (14%), SF3B1 (11%), TP53 (7%) and SRSF2 (6%). ASXL1 alteration due to chromosomal deletion or genetic mutation (ASXL1DEL/ASXL1MUT) was linked by multivariable analysis with shorter overall survival [hazard ratio, (HR) 1.84; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 1.11-3.04; P = 0.018] and a higher rate for acute myeloid leukaemia progression (HR 2.47; 95% CI: 1.07-5.70, P = 0.034). ASXL1DEL/ASXL1MUT patients were correlated by univariable analysis with a worse response to AZA. HAP1KN cells showed more resistance to AZA compared to HAP1WT cells. In conclusion, ASXL1 alteration exerts a negative impact on MDS with del(20q) and could become useful for prognostic risk stratification and treatment decisions.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","708-717","","4","194","","Br.

However, it is unknown how HMA with venetoclax compare to intensive chemotherapy (IC) in patients who are ""fit"" or ""unfit"" for IC. We compared outcomes of older patients with newly diagnosed AML receiving 10-day decitabine with venetoclax (DEC10-VEN) vs IC. DEC10-VEN consisted of daily venetoclax with decitabine 20 mg/m2 for 10 days for induction and decitabine for 5 days as consolidation. The IC cohort received regimens containing cytarabine >=1 g/m2/d. A validated treatment-related mortality score (TRMS) was used to classify patients at high-risk or low-risk for TRM with IC. Propensity scores were used to match patients to minimize bias. Median age of the DEC10-VEN cohort (n = 85) was 72 years (range 63-89) and 28% patients were at high-risk of TRM with IC. The comparator IC group (n = 85) matched closely in terms of baseline characteristics. DEC10-VEN was associated with significantly higher CR/CRi compared to IC (81% vs 52%, P <.001), and lower rate of relapse (34% vs 56%, P =.01), 30-day mortality (1% vs 24%, P <.01), and longer overall survival (OS; 12.4 vs 4.5 months, HR = 0.48, 95%CI 0.29-0.79, P <.01). In patients at both at high-risk and low-risk of TRM, DEC10-VEN showed significantly higher CR/CRi, lower 30-day mortality, and longer OS compared to IC. Patients at both high-risk and low-risk of TRM had comparable outcomes with DEC10-VEN. In conclusion, DEC10-VEN offers better outcomes compared to intensive chemotherapy in older patients with newly diagnosed AML, particularly in those at high-risk of TRM.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:27","2022-09-06 19:01:27","","282-291","","3","96","","Am.

However, the utility of MRD with venetoclax-based lower intensity regimens is unknown. We analyzed the prognostic value of achieving a negative MRD in older/""unfit"" patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. MRD was evaluated in bone marrow specimens using multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Ninety-seven patients achieving either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or morphologic leukemia-free state were included. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 68-78 years), and 64% had adverse-risk AML. Eighty-three patients achieved CR/CRi, and 52 (54%) became MRD negative. Median time to becoming MRD negative was 2.0 months (interquartile range, 0.9-3.1 months). Patients becoming MRD negative by 2 months had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those remaining MRD positive (median RFS, not reached vs 5.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.78; P 5 .004), longer event-free survival (EFS) (median EFS, not reached vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P, .001), as well as longer overall survival (OS) (median OS, 25.1 vs 7.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P, .001). Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had longer OS compared with those with an inferior response (median OS, 25.1 vs 11.6 months; HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58; P, .0005). Patients becoming MRD negative within 1 month had an improved OS compared with MRD-positive patients (median OS, 25.1 vs 3.4 months; HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.64; P, .0001). Differential impact of MRD status on survival outcomes persisted at a later 4-month time point of evaluation. In conclusion, MRD-negative status at 1, 2, and 4 months after starting therapy confers significantly better survival in older/unfit patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax.

We analyzed the results of 205 patients transplanted in one center during 2000-2017. Transplantation was performed on 75 patients without a previous autologous SCT (upfront-allo), on 74 as tandem transplant (auto-allo), and on 56 patients after relapse. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 years for upfront-allo, 11.2 years for auto-allo, and 3.9 years for the relapse group (p = 0.015). Progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4, 2.4, and 0.9 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Non-relapse mortality at 5 years was 8% overall, with no significant difference between the groups. Post-relapse survival was 4.1 years for upfront-allo and auto-allo, and 2.6 years for the relapse group (p = 0.066). Survival of high-risk patients was reduced. In multivariate analysis, the auto-allo group had improved OS and chronic graft-versus-host disease was advantageous in terms of PFS, OS, and relapse incidence. Late relapses occurred in all groups.

With this background, we compared outcomes among 377 cases of CR following consecutive HID-HSCT for AML (CR) to 86 MUD and 92 MSD-HSCT cases. All patients received BU-based myeloablative conditioning and an unmanipulated graft within the same period. The median patient age was 23 years (range 1.1 to 65 years), and 230 patients (41.4%) were under age18. Among the 555 patients, 432 (77.8%) were of intermediate cytogenetic risk and 123 (22.2%) were of adverse risk. A total of 113 patients (20.5%) had FLT3-ITD+ AML, 425 patients (76.6%) were in first complete remission (CR1) post-transplant, and 130 (23.4%) patients were in second CR (CR2). GVHD prophylaxis included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclosporine-A (CSA) with short-term methotrexate (MTX) for HID, and MUD-HSCT. MMF is not used for MSD-HSCT. The median survival follow-up time was 42 months (range 18-91 months). The 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts was 73.8% +/- 4.8%, 66.4% +/- 8.5%, 74.5% +/- 2.4%, respectively (P = 0.637). Three-year overall survival (OS) was 74.9% +/- 2.4%, 81.8% +/- 4.3%, and 77.5% +/- 4.5% among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts, respectively (P = 0.322). There were no difference among the relapse rate among the HID, MUD, and MSD donor cohorts (14.3% +/- 4.0% vs 20.3% +/- 6.4% vs 14.5% +/- 2.2, respectively; P = 0.851) or the non-relapse mortality (NRM) (12.3% +/- 3.5% vs 9.5% +/- 3.2% vs 14.0% +/- 1.8%, respectively; P = 0.441). Multivariate analyses showed that MRD-positive pre-HSCT was the only risk factor associated with a lower OS and LFS and higher risk of relapse among all 555 patients. Compared with the use of a MUD or MSD, an HID for HSCT had similar outcomes among AML patients with CR states who underwent an allo-HSCT with BU-based myeloablative conditioning. MFC-MRD-positive pre-HSCT was an independent negative factor impact on outcomes for AML patients in CR. We conclude that for AML patients who do not have a MSD or if an urgent transplant is required, HSCT from an HID is a valid option.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:28","2022-09-06 19:01:28","","1579-1591","","6","100","","Ann.

We retrospectively compared acute leukemia patients receiving 10/10 or 9/10 HLA allele-matched UD-HCT with PTCy-GvHD prophylaxis between 2010 and 2017, reported to EBMT registry. The 100-day incidence of grade >=2 and grade >=3 aGvHD were comparable for 10/10 and 9/10 UD (28% versus 28%, p = 0.8 and 10% versus 8%, p = 0.5, respectively). The 2-year cGvHD and extensive cGvHD were similar between 10/10 and 9/10 UD (35% versus 44%, p = 0.2 and 21% versus 20%, p = 0.6, respectively). The 2-year nonrelapse mortality was 20% after 10/10 and 16% after 9/10 UD-HCT (p = 0.1). Relapse incidence at 2-year was 24% for 10/10 and 28% for 9/10 UD-HCT (p = 0.4). Leukemia-free survival at 2-year was the same for 10/10 and 9/10 UD (56 and 56%, p = 0.6, respectively), with comparable overall survival (62 and 59%, p = 0.9, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed no effect of HLA-matching on outcomes. An advanced disease status and patient disability remained the most important factors portending a worse survival. PTCy could alleviate the detrimental effect of HLA-allele mismatching in UD-HCT, potentially expanding the donor pool for acute leukemia patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:28","2022-09-06 19:01:28","","585-594","","2","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\FYNU8TRV\Lorentino F. et al. - 2021 - Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide GvHD prophyl.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2004922970","*cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; *HLA matching; *hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer survival; *graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; *graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; incidence; cancer mortality; cancer free survival; cancer patient; allele; clinical outcome; mortality rate; *acute leukemia/th [Therapy]; register; *graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; *graft versus host reaction/ep [Epidemiology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore studied 937 patients with AML in complete remission transplanted using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen from an unrelated donor mismatched at a single allele. In a multivariate analysis, patient age, adverse karyotype and patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity were correlated with decreased leukaemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). There was no significant difference in LFS or OS between patients transplanted from donors mismatched at HLA-A, -B, -C or -DRB1 in comparison to a HLA-DQB1 mismatched transplant. In a multivariate analysis, patients transplanted with a HLA-A mismatched donor had higher rates of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) than patients transplanted with a HLA-DQB1 mismatched donor. Patient CMV seropositivity was associated with an increase in NRM and acute GVHD and reduced LFS and OS, regardless of donor CMV status.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a new pre-emptive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) strategy on relapse in Ph+ALL patients with complete remission undergoing allo-HCT. Pre-emptive TKIs initiation was based on BCR/ABL molecular monitoring. TKIs choice was based on BCR/ABL mutations. Donor lymphocyte infusion was recommended in those with poor response to TKIs. Prophylactic TKIs from historical data were as control. The primary endpoint was relapse. One hundred and sixty-seven Ph+ALL patients were enrolled in this study, including 103 in the pre-emptive group and 64 in the prophylactic group. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 11% and 31% in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups (P = 0.001), respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 87% and 66% (P = 0.001), and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 83% and 61% (P = 0.000), respectively, in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups.

A retrospective study of 279 cases of ALL treated with the CCCG-ALL-2015 regimen in the Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, from May 2015 to January 2017 was performed to analyse the prognostic impact of blood cell levels on day 19 of induction therapy by Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with childhood ALL with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <= 90 cells/mul, absolute monocyte count (AMC) <= 10 cells/mul or absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <= 1000 cells/mul on day 19 of induction therapy had a lower event-free survival (EFS) rate than those with higher values (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that ANC <= 90 cells/mul and ALC <= 1000 cells/mul were independent adverse prognostic factors (HR = 1.981 and 2.162, respectively, both P < 0.05). Among patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) < 1% on day 19 of induction therapy, those with ANC <= 90 cells/mul had lower EFS than those with ANC > 90 cells/mul (70.8 +/- 6.1% vs 86.4 +/- 3.1%, P = 0.001). In the subgroup with the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, patients with ANC <= 90 cells/mul on day 19 of induction therapy also had lower EFS than those with ANC > 90 cells/mul (34.4 +/- 25.2% vs 25.0 +/- 21.7%, P = 0.041).

In a pivotal phase 3 study, patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed, high-risk/secondary AML were randomized to receive CPX-351 or conventional 713 chemotherapy. In the primary endpoint analysis, CPX-351 demonstrated significantly prolonged median overall survival (OS) vs 713. These exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses evaluated the impact of achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery (CRi) with CPX-351 (73/153 [48%]) vs conventional 713 (52/56 [33%]) on outcomes. CPX-351 improved median OS vs 713 in patients who achieved CR or CRi (25.43 vs 10.41 months; hazard ratio 5 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.31, 0.77).

However, drug-drug interactions between letermovir and azoles or calcineurin inhibitors and the high financial burden of letermovir remain problematic, especially in resource-limited countries. It has not been clarified whether a lower dose of valganciclovir would constitute an effective strategy for CMV prevention in patients with acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT. Method(s): We retrospectively assessed 84 consecutive adult patients with acute leukemia who underwent allo-HSCT. These 84 patients were stratified into a valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 20) and a non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 64). Result(s): Patients in the valganciclovir prophylaxis group had a lower possibility of CMV DNAemia at week 14 after allo-HSCT than those in the non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (15.0% versus 50.0%; p = 0.012). The cumulative incidence of CMV DNAemia at week 14 was also lower in patients with valganciclovir CMV prophylaxis than in those without (15.0% versus 50.4%; p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis validated these data, showing that a low dose of valganciclovir significantly reduced the risk of CMV DNAemia at week 14 by 88% (hazard ratio: 0.12; 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42; p = 0.001). However, these two groups had similar overall survival rates at week 48 (75.0% versus 76.6%; p = 0.805). Four of 20 (20%) patients discontinued valganciclovir prophylaxis because of adverse events.

Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively studied PET-CT examinations and clinical data of 100 healthy individuals and 172 newly diagnosed MM patients. A BM uptake > liver SUVmean was selected as the positivity cut-off of pathological uptake in BM after comparing BM uptake in normal control and MM patients. With this interpretation cut-off, we defined the BM FDG uptake pattern as four types: normal, focal, diffuse, and mixed. The clinical correlation and prognostic value of BM uptake pattern were evaluated. The findings were validated in an independent prospective cohort with 72 MM patients. Result(s): In MM cohort, 34.9% patients had focal BM uptake pattern, 3.5% had diffuse pattern, 38.4% had mixed pattern, and 23.3% had normal BM uptake. Diffuse/mixed pattern was correlated with clinical and imaging parameters indicating high tumor burden, and inferior progression free survival (PFS; 3-year-PFS 26.8%) and overall survival (OS; 3-year-OS 50.6%). BM uptake pattern was an independent prognostic factor and diffuse/mixed pattern was associated with inferior OS (P = 0.037, HR 7.16) and PFS (P = 0.015, HR 7.77). The prognostic value of BM uptake pattern was also confirmed in validation set. Conclusion(s): We propose an FDG uptake higher than liver as the positivity cut-off to discriminate between physiological and pathological uptake in BM and defined four BM FDG uptake pattern. BM FDG uptake pattern is a reliable prognostic predictor of MM.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:28","2022-09-06 19:01:28","","2979-2988","","12","100","","Ann.

Findings from FILO group trials (CLL2007FMP, CLL2007SA, CLL2010FMP) enabled investigation of the prognostic value of high-sensitivity (0.7 x 10-5) MRD assessment using flow cytometry, in blood (N = 401) and bone marrow (N = 339), after fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)-based chemoimmunotherapy in a homogeneous population with long follow-up (median 49.5 months). Addition of low-level positive MRD < 0.01% to MRD >= 0.01% increased the proportion of cases with positive MRD in blood by 39% and in bone marrow by 27%. Compared to low-level positive MRD < 0.01%, undetectable MRD was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) when using blood (72.2 versus 42.7 months; hazard ratio 0.40, p = 0.0003), but not when using bone marrow. Upon further stratification, positive blood MRD at any level, compared to undetectable blood MRD, was associated with shorter PFS irrespective of clinical complete or partial remission, and a lower 5-year PFS rate irrespective of IGHV-mutated or -unmutated status (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, high-sensitivity (0.0007%) MRD assessment in blood yielded additional prognostic information beyond the current standard sensitivity (0.01%).

However, studies using binary analysis (presence/absence of CMV) reported contradicting data for NRM, overall survival and leukemia relapse. Here, we analyzed CMV replication kinetics in 11 508 whole blood PCR samples of 705 patients with HCT between 2012 and 2017. Using two independent models based on CMV peak titers and on the time point of first CMV reactivation, we stratified patients into risk cohorts. Each cohort had distinct cellular immune reconstitution profiles and differentiated for relevant clinical outcomes. Patients with high CMV peak titers had significantly reduced overall survival (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.53-2.96; p <.0001), due to high NRM. Early impaired T cell reconstitution was a risk factor for high CMV peak titers, however relevant CMV viremia also related to boosted T cell reconstitution. Importantly, intermediate CMV peak titers associated with a significantly reduced relapse probability (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.91; p =.022). In short, CMV kinetics models distinguished relevant clinical outcome cohorts beyond the R+ serostatus with distinct immune reconstitution patterns and resolve in part contradicting results of previous studies exclusively focused on the presence or absence of CMV.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

In a part-prospective, part-retrospective study, we enrolled 219 adults with ALL in France to assess the impact of key disease and treatment characteristics on HRQoL. Overall HRQoL and most specific QoL domain scores were consistently better among patients receiving front-line therapy, those currently in complete remission, and those who had previously received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Furthermore, HRQoL was consistently impaired in patients with minimal residual disease present (MRD+). In multivariate analyses, multiple lines of therapy, MRD+, leukopenia, comorbidities, and anemia were significantly associated with impaired HRQoL.

Total score was calculated, thus dividing patient into three groups: low (score 0, n=349, 41.3%), intermediate (score 1, n=379, 44.9%), and high risk (score 2; n=116, 13.7%). This risk score could stratify the patients according to AVN risk (p<0.001). The risk of AVN was 1.5% in the low risk, 6.2% in the intermediate risk, and 20.8% in the high risk groups. Moderate-severe chronic GvHD and younger age (<45 years) are key risk factors for AVN following allogeneic HCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:28","2022-09-06 19:01:28","","1311-1319","","5","100","","Ann.

The risk of death was reduced by 22% on the midostaurin-containing arm. In this post hoc analysis, we analyzed the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) on this study and also evaluated the impact of 12 4-week cycles of maintenance therapy. CIR analyses treated relapses and AML deaths as events, deaths from other causes as competing risks, and survivors in remission were censored. CIR was improved on the midostaurin arm (HR = 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54-0.93); p = 0.01), both overall and within European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk classification subsets when post-transplant events were considered in the analysis as events. However, when transplantation was considered as a competing risk, there was overall no significant difference between the risks of relapse on the two randomized arms. Patients still in remission after consolidation with high-dose cytarabine entered the maintenance phase, continuing with either midostaurin or placebo. Analyses were inconclusive in quantifying the impact of the maintenance phase on the overall outcome.

CPX-351 is a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a synergistic 1:5 molar ratio. Primary analysis of the phase 3 trial in adults aged 60-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia provided support for approval of CPX-351 by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. We describe the prospectively planned final 5-year follow-up results. Method(s): This randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done across 39 academic and regional cancer centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 60-75 years and had a pathological diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia according to WHO 2008 criteria, no previous induction therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 (stratified by age and acute myeloid leukaemia subtype) to receive up to two induction cycles of CPX-351 (100 units/m2 administered as a 90-min intravenous infusion on days 1, 3, and 5; on days 1 and 3 for the second induction) or standard chemotherapy (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days plus intravenous daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 [7+3]; cytarabine for 5 days and daunorubicin on days 1 and 2 for the second induction [5+2]). Patients with complete remission or complete remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery could receive up to tw cycles of consolidation therapy with CPX-351 (65 units/m2 90-min infusion on days 1 and 3) or chemotherapy (5+2, same dosage as in the second induction cycle). The primary outcome was overall survival analysed in all randomly assigned patients. No additional adverse events were collected with long-term follow-up, except data for deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01696084, and is complete. Finding(s): Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 11, 2014, 309 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive CPX-351 (153 patients) or 7+3 (156 patients). At a median follow-up of 60.91 months (IQR 60.06-62.98) in the CPX-351 group and 59.93 months (59.73-60.50) in the 7+3 group, median overall survival was 9.33 months (95% CI 6.37-11.86) with CPX-351 and 5.95 months (4.99-7.75) with 7+3 (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.91). 5-year overall survival was 18% (95% CI 12-25%) in the CPX-351 group and 8% (4-13%) in the 7+3 group. The most common cause of death in both groups was progressive leukaemia (70 [56%] of 124 deaths in the CPX-351 group and 74 [53%] of 140 deaths in the 7+3 group). Six (5%) of 124 deaths in the CPX-351 group and seven (5%) of 140 deaths in the 7+3 group were considered related to study treatment. Interpretation(s): After 5 years of follow-up, the improved overall survival with CPX-351 versus 7+3 was maintained, which supports the previous evidence that CPX-351 can contribute to long-term remission and improved overall survival in patients aged 60-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling controls the epigenetic tuning of CD+1 T-cell differentiation and polarization, and perturbed STAT signaling networks in CD+1 T cells subvert antitumor immunity in malignancies. Azacitidine (AZA), the mainstay therapy for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS), affects CD+1 T-cell polarization and function, but whether this contributes to AZA efficacy is currently unknown. By using functional proteomic, transcriptomic, andmutational analyses in 73 HR-MDS patients undergoing AZA therapy, we demonstrate that responding patients exhibited a coordinated CD+1 T-cell immune response and downregulated the inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in CD+1 T cells after AZA, in contrast to nonresponders who upregulated the same pathways. We further observed an AZA-mediated downregulation of intereukin-6 (IL-6)- induced STAT3 phosphorylation in CD+1FOXP32 conventional T cells (Tcons) that correlated independently with better response and survival, whereas it was also not associated with the mutation number and profile of the patients. The AZA-induced downregulation of IL-6/STAT3 axis in Tcons restored the STAT signaling architecture in CD+1 T-cell subsets, whereas STAT signaling networks remained disorganized in patients who upregulated IL-6/STAT3 activity in Tcons. Given the pivotal role of CD+1 T cells in adaptive immunity, our findings suggest that the downregulation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in Tcons potentially constitutes a previously unrecognized immune-mediatedmechanism of action of AZA and sets the scene for developing rational strategies of AZA combinations with IL-6/STAT3 axis inhibitors.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","129-142","","1","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\V8PICUGX\Lamprianidou E. et al. - 2021 - Modulation of IL-6STAT3 signaling axis in CD41FOX.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010630614","aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; human cell; drug dose reduction; priority journal; treatment response; high risk patient; *azacitidine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *azacitidine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *azacitidine/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]; multiple cycle treatment; survival analysis; mutational analysis; upregulation; T lymphocyte subpopulation; adaptive immunity; *antineoplastic activity; *azacitidine/pd [Pharmacology]; *CD4+ T lymphocyte; *interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *signal transduction; *STAT3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *transcription factor FOXP3/ec [Endogenous Compound]; cellular immunity; down regulation; lymphocyte function; lymphocyte structure; myelodysplastic syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]; protein function; protein phosphorylation; proteomics; transcriptomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for renal overall response (ROR) and renal complete response (RCR) using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for baseline covariates. Included were 543 Kdtreated and 1005 Vd-treated patients. In line 2 (2L), compared with Vd, Kd achieved significantly higher ROR (51.4% vs 39.6%; P <.0001) and RCR (26.6% vs 22.2%; P =0229). After baseline covariate adjustment, 2L patients receiving Kd vs Vd were 45% more likely to achieve ROR (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18-1.78), and 68% were more likely to achieve RCR (IRR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.24-2.28). The renal response benefit with Kd remained consistent in 2L to line 4 (4L). In a combined analysis of patients receiving Kd and Vd (2L and 2L-4L), renal responders had longer overall survival and time to next treatment than renal nonresponders. These results demonstrate improved real-world effectiveness of Kd over Vd in RRMM renal rescue, and the positive association between renal response and improved survival.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","367-376","","2","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\VXANMHG3\Kumar S. et al. - 2021 - Renal response in real-world carfilzomib-vs bortez.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010821489","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cancer survival; priority journal; cancer incidence; treatment outcome; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; *cancer recurrence; *multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy]; proportional hazards model; age distribution; lenalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]; dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; dexamethasone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; creatinine blood level; lenalidomide/cb [Drug Combination]; *bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination]; *bortezomib/dt [Drug Therapy]; *bortezomib/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; electronic medical record; lenalidomide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *carfilzomib/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *multiple myeloma/di [Diagnosis]; clinical effectiveness; sex difference; *bortezomib/cm [Drug Comparison]; *carfilzomib/cm [Drug Comparison]; *carfilzomib/dt [Drug Therapy]; *kidney function; *refractory multiple myeloma/di [Diagnosis]; *refractory multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy]; *treatment response; estimated glomerular filtration rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accounting for known KIR-KIRL interactions may identify donors with optimal NK cell-mediated alloreactivity and GVL. A retrospective study of 2359 donor-recipient pairs (DRP) who underwent unrelated donor (URD) HCT for AML was performed. KIR-KIRL combinations were determined and associations with clinical outcomes examined. Relapse risk was reduced in DRP with both higher inhibitory KIR-KIRL (iKIR) and missing KIRL (mKIR) scores, with HR 0.86 (P = 0.01) & HR 0.84 (P = 0.02) respectively. The iKIR and mKIR score components were summed to give a maximal inhibitory KIR ligand (IM-KIR) score for each donor, which if it was 5, as opposed to <5, was also associated with a lower relapse risk, SHR 0.8 (P = 0.004). All IM = 5 donors possess KIR Haplotype B/x. Transplant-related mortality was increased among those with IM-KIR = 5, HR, 1.32 (P = 0.01). In a subset analysis of those transplanted with 8/8 HLA-matched DRP, anti-thymocyte globulin recipients with IM-KIR = 5, had a lower relapse rate HR, 0.61 (p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that HLA-matched unrelated donors with the highest inhibitory KIR content confer relapse protection, albeit with increased TRM. These donors all have KIR haplotype B. Clinical trials utilizing donors with a higher iKIR content in conjunction with novel strategies to reduce TRM should be considered for URD HCT in recipients with AML to optimize clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","2714-2722","","11","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\VWDTAXN3\Krieger E. et al. - 2021 - Increased donor inhibitory KIR with known HLA inte.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2013092921","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; human cell; mortality; outcome assessment; *matched unrelated donor; recurrence risk; thymocyte antibody; clinical outcome; haplotype; *relapse; endogenous compound; hematopoietic cell; killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor; transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present the long-term follow-up analysis of the pivotal, multicenter, open-label trial (NCT01829711) of moxetumomab pasudotox in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Method(s): Eligible patients had received >= 2 prior systemic therapies, including >= 2 purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs), or >= 1 PNA followed by rituximab or a BRAF inhibitor. Patients received 40 microg/kg moxetumomab pasudotox intravenously on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day cycle for up to six cycles. Disease response and minimal residual disease (MRD) status were determined by blinded independent central review. The primary endpoint was durable complete response (CR), defined as achieving CR with hematologic remission (HR, blood counts for CR) lasting > 180 days. Result(s): Eighty adult patients were treated with moxetumomab pasudotox and 63% completed six cycles. Patients had received a median of three lines of prior systemic therapy; 49% were PNA-refractory, and 38% were unfit for PNA retreatment. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the durable CR rate (CR with HR > 180 days) was 36% (29 patients; 95% confidence interval: 26-48%); CR with HR >= 360 days was 33%, and overall CR was 41%. Twenty-seven complete responders (82%) were MRD-negative (34% of all patients). CR lasting >= 60 months was 61%, and the median progression-free survival without the loss of HR was 71.7 months. Hemolytic uremic and capillary leak syndromes were each reported in <= 10% of patients, and <= 5% had grade 3-4 events; these events were generally reversible. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion(s): Moxetumomab pasudotox resulted in a high rate of durable responses and MRD negativity in heavily pre-treated patients with HCL, with a manageable safety profile. Thus, it represents a new and viable treatment option for patients with R/R HCL, who currently lack adequate therapy.

We retrospectively evaluated the effect of pretransplant MRD, which was measured by a polymerase chain reaction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts, on transplant outcomes for a cohort of 959 adult patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML treated by allogeneic HCT during complete remission (CR), between 2000 and 2018. Multivariate analysis showed the absence of pretransplant MRD was significantly associated with lower relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P < 0.001), treatment failure (HR, 0.66; P = 0.004), and overall mortality (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) among patients with t(8;21). However, pretransplant MRD negativity was not associated with relapse (HR, 0.73; P = 0.420), treatment failure (HR, 0.64; P = 0.063), or overall mortality (HR, 0.69; P = 0.149) among patients with inv(16). In subgroup analysis, pretransplant MRD status significantly affected relapse and LFS only in patients with t(8;21) undergoing allogeneic HCT during CR2.

The availability of alternative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donors, such as cord blood and haploidentical related donors, could allow patients to receive allogeneic HCT who are without an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The use of these alternative donors is preferable for patients with advanced disease due to the rapid availability. However, comparative data for cord blood transplantation (CBT) and haploidentical related donor transplantation (haplo-HCT) are limited for adult patients with AML in CR. We sought to compare overall survival (OS); leukemia-free survival (LFS); graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS); and chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (CRFS) between single-unit CBT (SCBT) and haplo-HCT recipients for adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR. We retrospectively analyzed and compared the results of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in 1313 adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR who received either SCBT (n = 1102) or unmanipulated haplo-HCT (n = 211) between 2007 and 2018 in Japan. Among the whole cohort, the cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet recovery were significantly lower in SCBT recipients compared with those in haplo-HCT recipients (P < .001 for neutrophil, P < .001 for platelet). SCBT was significantly associated with a higher incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD and lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD compared to haplo-HCT (P = .013 for grades II to IV acute GVHD; P = .006 for extensive chronic GVHD). Haplo-HCT recipients developed a higher incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia compared to SCBT recipients (P = .004). In the multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences for grades III or IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI],. 88 to 1.57; P = .26), relapse incidence (HR, 1.09; 95% CI,. 76 to 1.58; P = .61), non-relapse mortality (HR,. 83; 95% CI,. 58 to 1.18; P = .32), OS (HR,. 92; 95% CI,. 70 to 1.20; P = .56), LFS (HR,. 94; 95% CI,. 73 to 1.21; P = .67), GRFS (HR, 1.12; 95% CI,. 90 to 1.40; P = .27), or CRFS (HR, 1.15; 95% CI,. 92 to 1.44; P = .19) between the two donor types. In the propensity score matching analysis, which identified 180 patients in each cohort, there were no significant differences in transplant outcomes between the two donor types, except for delayed neutrophil (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P < .001) and a higher incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD (P = .052) in SCBT. SCBT and unmanipulated haplo-HCT had similar survival outcomes for adult patients with AML in CR despite the lower hematopoietic recovery and higher grade II to IV acute GVHD in SCBT recipients and the higher CMV antigenemia in haplo-HCT recipients.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","334.e1-334.e11","","4","27","","Transplant.

However, it remains less clear whether pretransplantation RBC or platelet transfusion burden affects transplant outcomes in patients with MDS. The objective was to examine the significance of pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burden on transplant outcomes after allogeneic HCT for adults with de novo MDS. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of pretransplantation RBC or platelet transfusion burden on transplant outcomes in a cohort of 1007 adult patients with de novo MDS treated by upfront allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) between 2006 and 2018. Both higher pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burdens were significantly associated with higher overall mortality and relapse-related mortality, but not non-relapse mortality in the multivariate analysis. Higher pretransplantation RBC transfusion burden was also significantly associated with lower neutrophil, platelet, and reticulocyte recovery in the multivariate analysis. In summary, our study clearly demonstrated that a higher pretransplantation RBC and platelet transfusion burden was independently associated with higher overall mortality, relapse-related mortality, and lower hematopoietic recovery after allogeneic HCT for de novo MDS. Early allogeneic HCT should be considered for patients with de novo MDS who require RBC and platelet transfusion repeatedly.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","671-678","","8","27","","Transplant.

In this study, we investigated a potential graft-versus-leukemia effect of gammadelta T cell reconstitution post-transplantation in AML patients with pretransplantation positive MRD status (MRD+). MRD assessment was performed in 202 patients using multicolored flow cytometry (""different from normal"" strategy); 100 patients were deemed MRD+. Analysis for absolute concentrations of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, natural killer, and gammadelta T cells were performed by flow cytometry according to an internal protocol at day +30 and +100 post-transplantation. Differences between categorical and continuous variables were determined using the chi-square and Student t test, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare medians of continuous variables. Spearman's correlation was used for nonparametric assessment of correlation between different cell subsets during immune reconstitution. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the associations between immune reconstitution and survival outcomes. Gray's analysis was used to compute incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The median follow-up of survivors was 28 months (range 3 to 59 months). Younger age (<=58 years) of recipient and donor (<30 years), sex mismatch, use of a matched donor, cytomegalovirus reactivation, and administration of antithymocyte globulin were associated with a faster gammadelta T cell reconstitution. In multivariable analysis for MRD+ patients, a higher than median level of gammadelta T cells on days +30 and +100 resulted in significantly improved leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42 [P =.007] and 0.42 [P =.011], respectively) and overall survival (HR, 0.44 [P =.038] and 0.33 [P =.009], respectively). Furthermore, a higher gammadelta T cell level on day +30 was associated with a significantly reduced risk of relapse (HR, 0.36; P =.019). No impact of gammadelta T cell level on relapse at days +30 and +100 could be seen in MRD-negative patients, and no correlation with occurrence of GVHD was observed. Our data indicate that enhanced immune reconstitution of gammadelta T cells post-transplantation may overcome the higher relapse risk of pretransplantation MRD+ status in patients with AML.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","841-850","","10","27","","Transplant.

Recent studies re-evaluating this dichotomous variable have shown that higher numbers of cytogenetic abnormalities (ie, >=5) have a worse overall survival in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. We sought to determine if increasing karyotypic complexity, treated as a continuous variable, was prognostic of survival for patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody at our institution. We included 456 patients with both treatment-naive and RR disease. Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-13), 30% of patients had presence of del(17p), and 75% expressed unmutated IGHV. Fifty percent had >=3 cytogenetic abnormalities, including 30% with >=5. In a multivariable analysis, increasing karyotypic complexity was an independent predictor of shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.10; P < .0001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.12; P < .0001). Furthermore, we found that presence of clonal evolution determined by cytogenetic analysis at progression was prognostic of subsequent survival (P = .02). This solidifies karyotypic complexity as an important prognostic factor for patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. Further research should consider sequential karyotypic analysis as a determination of risk of progression and death in patients with CLL.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:29","2022-09-06 19:01:29","","2372-2382","","23","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","; C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\VFC4H94Q\Kittai A.S. et al. - 2021 - The impact of increasing karyotypic complexity and.pdf","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2015890047","adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; cancer recurrence; follow up; *cancer chemotherapy; survival rate; cancer combination chemotherapy; treatment duration; *cancer survival; cancer growth; mortality risk; cancer staging; fluorescence in situ hybridization; immunoglobulin heavy chain/ec [Endogenous Compound]; leukocyte count; drug withdrawal; disease exacerbation; cancer resistance; gene mutation; side effect/si [Side Effect]; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *ibrutinib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; *ibrutinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; *ibrutinib/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; ECOG Performance Status; rituximab/dt [Drug Therapy]; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; platelet count; hemoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; chromosome aberration; chromosome analysis; chromosome deletion; median survival time; hemoglobin blood level; chromosome 17p; trisomy 12; obinutuzumab/cb [Drug Combination]; obinutuzumab/dt [Drug Therapy]; rituximab/cb [Drug Combination]; rituximab/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/dr [Drug Resistance]; *ibrutinib/cb [Drug Combination]; *ibrutinib/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; *karyotype evolution; atrial fibrillation/si [Side Effect]; chromosome 11q; chromosome 13q; chromosome rearrangement; clonal evolution; lactate dehydrogenase; monoclonal antibody therapy; obinutuzumab/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; ofatumumab/cb [Drug Combination]; ofatumumab/dt [Drug Therapy]; ofatumumab/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; patient history of chemotherapy; structural chromosome aberration; treatment withdrawal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the in-hospital mortality according to early removal of CVCs and the factors influencing the mortality in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. This study retrospectively analyzed the hospital record data of 278 patients with acute leukemia treated with non-tunneled CVCs and remission induction chemotherapy in a single institution. Bloodstream infection was more common (p < 0.0001) and median peak C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after neutropenic fever were significantly higher (23.3 vs. 14.5 mg/dl, p = 0.003) in the group with early removal than in the group with maintenance of the CVC. Multivariate analysis of the patients revealed a significant decrease in the mortality with female gender (odds ratio (OR): 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.54, p = 0.002) and a significant increase in the mortality according to the peak CRP (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17, p < 0.0001). By contrast, early removal of the CVC had no significant effect on the mortality (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.54-2.47, p = 0.706) in univariate analysis. Furthermore, subsequent bloodstream infection after clinical decision for maintenance or early removal of the CVC was confirmed more frequently in the group with early removal (early removal, 22.6%; maintenance, 7.6%, p < 0.0001). Early removal of the CVC had no benefit regarding the mortality and prophylaxis of bloodstream infection in patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. Therefore, maintaining a CVC for as long as possible may be considered, if catheter-related bloodstream infection is not strongly suspected.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","2825-2830","","11","100","","Ann.

Both total body irradiation (TBI)-based and chemotherapy only-based myeloablative transplantation conditioning regimens have been applied, but the optimal regimen remains unclear. We performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy of TBI-based versus chemotherapy only-based myeloablative conditioning regimens. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and meeting abstracts for all studies comparing TBI-based and chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL. Two authors independently reviewed all studies for inclusion and extracted data related to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Eight studies were included in the final analysis. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was optimal. TBI-based regimens showed evidence of benefit compared with chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in terms of relapse (relative risk [RR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.94; 6 studies, 5091 patients), OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89; 7 studies, 4727 patients), and PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.85; 7 studies, 4727 patients). The TBI-based regimen did not increase the likelihood of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.36; 5 studies, 4996 patients) or chronic GVHD (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21; 5 studies, 4490 patients), or NRM (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.28; 6 studies, 4522 patients). However, TBI-based regimens were associated with an increased risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.63; 3 studies, 3675 patients). A subgroup comparison of patients age >=16 years showed similar results. This systematic review represents evidence supporting the use of TBI-based conditioning regimen in patients undergoing allo-HCT for ALL who are candidates for myeloablative conditioning, as it offers better OS, PFS, and less relapse with acceptable NRM.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","620.e1-620.e9","","7","27","","Transplant.

Eligibility criteria required adults aged >=18 years who received a second allo-HCT for treating AML relapse between 2005 and 2019. The primary end-point was OS. There was no statistically significant difference in the median (interquartile range) age between the groups, MUD 46 (35-58) versus haploidentical 44 (33-53) years (P = 0.07). The median OS was not different between the MUD and the haploidentical groups (10 vs. 11 months, P = 0.57). Similarly, the 2-year OS was 31% for the MUD and 29% for the haploidentical donor groups. The OS was worse if the procedure was performed with active AML [hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.89; P = 0.02]. Conversely, a longer time from first allo-HCT to relapse (>13.2 months) was associated with better OS (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.69; P < 0.0001). The results of the present analysis limit the ability to recommend one donor type over another when considering a second allo-HCT for relapsed AML. Our findings highlight that best OS is achieved when receiving the second allo-HCT in complete remission.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","592-601","","3","193","","Br.

This suggests that other signaling molecules are involved in disease escape mechanisms and resistance. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a promising candidate that is activated by unmethylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide-DNA. Here, we show that plasma from patients with CLL contains significantly more unmethylated DNA than plasma from healthy control subjects (P <.0001) and that cell-free DNA levels correlate with the prognostic markers CD38, beta2-microglobulin, and lymphocyte doubling time. Furthermore, elevated cell-free DNA was associated with shorter time to first treatment (hazard ratio, 4.0; P =.003). We also show that TLR9 expression was associated with in vitro CLL cell migration (P <.001), and intracellular endosomal TLR9 strongly correlated with aberrant surface expression (sTLR9; r = 0.9). In addition, lymph node-derived CLL cells exhibited increased sTLR9 (P =.016), and RNA-sequencing of paired sTLR9hi and sTLR9lo CLL cells revealed differential transcription of genes involved in TLR signaling, adhesion, motility, and inflammation in sTLR9hi cells. Mechanistically, a TLR9 agonist, ODN2006, promoted CLL cell migration (P <.001) that was mediated by p65 NF-kappaB and STAT3 transcription factor activation. Importantly, autologous plasma induced the same effects, which were reversed by a TLR9 antagonist. Furthermore, high TLR9 expression promoted engraftment and rapid disease progression in a NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgammanull mouse xenograft model. Finally, we showed that dual targeting of TLR9 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) was strongly synergistic (median combination index, 0.2 at half maximal effective dose), which highlights the distinct role for TLR9 signaling in CLL and the potential for combined targeting of TLR9 and BTK as a more effective treatment strategy in this incurable disease.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","3064-3078","","22","137","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\JSHJ2AH9\Kennedy E. et al. - 2021 - TLR9 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia id.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012739148","article; controlled study; human; cancer prognosis; priority journal; cancer chemotherapy; xenotransplantation; leukocyte count; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; ibrutinib/dt [Drug Therapy]; immunophenotyping; RNA sequencing; *protein expression; correlational study; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; engraftment; ADP ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CD19 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CD5 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; genetic transcription; in vitro study; beta 2 microglobulin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; cell proliferation; *cell migration; *cell subpopulation; *toll like receptor 9/ec [Endogenous Compound]; alpha4 integrin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; blood autotransfusion; Bruton tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CD69 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; cell adhesion; cell motility; lymphocyte activation; mitochondrial DNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]; noninvasive prenatal testing; real time polymerase chain reaction; STAT3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; surface property; TLR signaling; transcription factor RelA/ec [Endogenous Compound]; transwell assay; upregulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 126 patients (42.6%) who developed early-onset EBV viremia, with a median time of 48 (range 18~99) days after allo-HSCT. The cumulative incidence of EBV viremia at 30 and 90 days after allo-HSCT were 4.1 and 39.9%, respectively. Prognostic analysis showed that the adjusted overall survival in early-EBVpos group was significantly lower than early-EBVneg group within the first 26.7 months after allo-HSCT [hazard ratio (HR), 1.63, P = 0.012], but significantly higher than those afterward (after 26.7 months: HR 0.11, P = 0.035); for the adjusted event-free survival, early-EBVpos group was significantly inferior in early-EBVpos group within the first 10.8 months after transplantation (HR: 1.55, P = 0.042), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after 10.8 months (HR: 0.58, P = 0.107). Compared with early-EBVneg group after adjusting by aGVHD and CMV viremia, HR for death from transplant-related mortality was 2.78-fold higher in patients with early-EBV viremia in piecewise constant Cox analysis (P = 0.006), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after the cut-point time (HR: 0.67, P = 0.361). No differences in terms of relapse and relapse mortality were observed between early-EBVpos and early-EBVneg group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the impacts on transplant outcomes of early-EBV viremia were time-dependent, which may help to optimize management strategies for early-EBV viremia after allo-HSCT, especially in AL patients with ATG-containing MAC regimen.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","1879-1889","","7","100","","Ann.

Previous small series suggested poor outcome. We report on 59 patients with t(8;16) within an international, collaborative study. Median age was 52 (range: 16-75) years. AML was de novo in 58%, therapy-related (t-AML) in 37% and secondary after myelodysplastic syndrome (s-AML) in 5%. Cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype in 43%. Besides MYST3-CREBBP, whole-genome sequencing on a subset of 10 patients revealed recurrent mutations in ASXL1, BRD3, FLT3, MLH1, POLG, TP53, SAMD4B (n = 3, each), EYS, KRTAP9-1 SPTBN5 (n = 4, each), RUNX1 and TET2 (n = 2, each). Complete remission after intensive chemotherapy was achieved in 84%. Median follow-up was 5.48 years; five-year survival rate was 17%. Patients with s-/t-AML (P = 0.01) and those with complex karyotype (P = 0.04) had an inferior prognosis. Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) was performed in 21 (36%) patients, including 15 in first complete remission (CR1). Allo-HCT in CR1 significantly improved survival (P = 0.04); multivariable analysis revealed that allo-HCT in CR1 was effective in de novo AML but not in patients with s-AML/t-AML and less in patients exhibiting a complex karyotype. In summary, outcomes of patients with t(8;16) are dismal with chemotherapy, and may be substantially improved with allo-HCT performed in CR1.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We prospectively investigated the effect of CFZ on endothelial function and associations with CVAEs. Forty-eight patients treated with Kd (CFZ 20/56 mg/m2 and dexamethasone) underwent serial endothelial function evaluation, using brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and 26S proteasome activity (PrA) measurement in PBMCs; patients were followed until disease progression or cycle 6 for a median of 10 months. FMD and PrA decreased acutely after the first dose (p < 0.01) and FMD decreased at cycles 3 and 6 compared to baseline (p <= 0.05). FMD changes were associated with CFZ-induced PrA changes (p < 0.05) and lower PrA recovery during first cycle was associated with more prominent FMD decrease (p = 0.034 for group interaction). During treatment, 25 patients developed Grade >=3 CVAEs. Low baseline FMD (HR 2.57 lowest vs. higher tertiles, 95% CI 1.081-6.1) was an independent predictor of CVAEs. During treatment, an acute FMD decrease >40% at the end of first cycle was also independently associated with CVAEs (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.29-11.83). Kd treatment impairs endothelial function which is associated with PrA inhibition and recovery. Both pre- and posttreatment FMD predicted CFZ-related CVAEs supporting its role as a possible cardiovascular toxicity biomarker.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","1418-1427","","5","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\TL6H8XDS\Kastritis E. et al. - 2021 - Carfilzomib-induced endothelial dysfunction, recov.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010487878","adult; aged; article; female; human; male; prospective study; priority journal; survival rate; multiple cycle treatment; prediction; clinical article; cancer immunotherapy; *carfilzomib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]; enzyme activity; *carfilzomib/ct [Clinical Trial]; *endothelial dysfunction/si [Side Effect]; cardiotoxicity/si [Side Effect]; flow-mediated dilation test; proteasome/ec [Endogenous Compound]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed the genomic data of a subset of 100 patients. Men had 0.88 more somatic mutations on average (95% CI 0.20-1.56, P = 0.011) independent of subtype, sample source and blast percentage. More somatic mutations was associated with a higher incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (subdistribution HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.70; P = 0.046). Men had 0.70 more mutations in high-risk genes [additional sex combs like-1 (ASXL1), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), stromal antigen 2 (STAG2)] on average (95% CI 0.11-1.29, P = 0.021), and 13-times higher odds of harbouring an EZH2 mutation (95% CI 1.64-102.94, P = 0.015). The presence of an EZH2 mutation was associated with worse survival among men (HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.1-8.0; P = 0.031). Our present findings suggest that the worse outcomes in men with MDS/MPN are associated with a higher number of somatic mutations, especially in high-risk genes.

We selected all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer between January 1st, 2002 and December 31st, 2016 who received curative treatment (N = 84,969) and a 1:10 sample of age-matched non-breast cancer controls (N = 1,057,674). Incident breast cancer (time-varying exposure) was the exposure and development of any type of NHL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mature T/NK-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and unspecified types of NHL, was the outcome. During follow-up, 1564 incident cases of NHL occurred. The fully adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) for NHL associated with the development of breast cancer was 1.64 (95% CI = 1.34-2.00) after adjusting for body mass index, alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, income, and comorbidity. The adjusted HR for NHL was much higher in participants who were aged <50 years and who received hormone therapy (either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) than in those >=50 years or who did not receive hormone therapy, respectively. The development of breast cancer was associated with a significantly increased risk of NHL, particularly follicular lymphoma and mature T/NK-cell lymphoma. In particular, the risk of NHL was higher in patients receiving hormone therapy and in younger patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","200","","12","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\SUFUIRG5\Kang D. et al. - 2021 - Risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in breast cancer surv.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2014467378","adult; article; cohort analysis; cumulative incidence; female; human; retrospective study; adolescent; child; follow up; age; cancer incidence; population research; comorbidity; *cancer survival; body mass; obesity; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; *risk assessment; chemoradiotherapy; *nonhodgkin lymphoma; anaplastic large cell lymphoma; multimodality cancer therapy; cancer registry; *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy]; *cancer risk; alcohol consumption; aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer hormone therapy; diagnosis time; early cancer diagnosis; follicular lymphoma; menarche; menopause; NK T cell lymphoma; personal income; physical activity; smoking habit; tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the second era, superior OS rates were seen with the use of intensive HD-MTX protocols (including consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation) compared to non-intensive HD-MTX schedules (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-0.99). Initiating chemotherapy within 14 days of biopsy and use of rituximab were independently associated with improved OS and progression-free survival during the second era.

In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed 87 consecutive symptomatic TEMM (transplant-eligible) and 126 TIMM (transplant-ineligible) patients treated at our institution that did undergo NTproBNP testing from 2017 to 2020. Median age at diagnosis was 59.3 years and 75.4 years for the TEMM and TIMM groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). NTproBNP >= 300 ng/L was used to assess survival outcomes in the group of symptomatic MM. Patients with AL amyloidosis and symptomatic MM were excluded from the study. Median OS for patients with NTproBNP >= 300 ng/L was shorter (45.9 months) as compared to those with NTproBNP of < 300 ng/L (non-reached) (p = 0.0001). In addition, OS was shorter for those with CCI > 2, ISS2-3, and high-risk cytogenetics by FISH and >= 70 years of age. Multivariate analysis showed that HR cytogenetics and ISS2-3 were independent predictors for OS in the entire cohort of MM patients. When restricted to TIMM, age >= 80 years and NTproBNP >= 800 ng/L were predictors for OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, NTproBNP appears to be an independent predictor factor for OS in symptomatic TIMM patients. The use of NTproBNP as a frailty marker remains to be elucidated.

However, little comparative data exist to inform the selection of regimens. We assessed the outcomes for TIMM patients treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone or prednisone (CyBorD/P), bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP), bortezomib and dexamethasone or prednisone (VD/P) and lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Ld) using the Canadian Myeloma Research Group database. Of 1156 TIMM patients evaluated, 82% received bortezomib combinations while 18% received Ld. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.0, 21.1, 13.2 and 28.5 months (P = 0.0002) and median overall survival (OS) was 52.0, 63.6, 30.8 and 65.7 months (P < 0.0001) in the CyBorD/P, VMP, VD/P and Ld groups respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS and OS between the two triplet bortezomib regimens (VMP and CyBorD/P). Ld was associated with a longer PFS but not a significantly superior OS to date. Outcomes with the bortezomib-steroid doublet were inferior (VD/P). However, multivariable analysis identified features related to disease biology as the most important prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Such factors, as well as those affecting the physician's choice of regimen, are likely to influence the results observed with different regimens. This study demonstrated real-world outcomes in TIMM similar to those reported in clinical trials.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:30","2022-09-06 19:01:30","","532-541","","3","193","","Br.

The incidence of the following hematologic cancers was determined based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision: Multiple Myeloma (MM), Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), Lymphoid Leukemia (LL), and Myeloid Leukemia (ML). During an average of 8.3 years of follow-up (79,179,225 person-years), 15,864 incident hematologic malignancies were identified.

In general s/tAML patients have inferior outcomes after chemotherapy, compared to de novo cases and often receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for consolidation.

We analyzed 644 s/tAML or de novo AML patients receiving HSCT. s/tAML associated with older age and adverse risk, including higher ELN risk. Overall, s/tAML patients had similar cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), but higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and shorter overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for ELN risk and pre-HSCT measurable residual disease status, disease origin did not impact outcomes. Within the ELN favorable risk group, CIR was higher in s/tAML compared to de novo AML patients likely due to a different distribution of genetic aberrations, which did not translate into shorter OS. Within the ELN intermediate and adverse group outcomes were similar in de novo and s/tAML patients. Thus, not all s/tAML have a dismal prognosis and outcomes of s/tAML after allogeneic HSCT in remission are comparable to de novo patients when considering ELN risk.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","936-945","","4","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\45XHHJNA\Jentzsch M. et al. - 2021 - ELN risk stratification and outcomes in secondary .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2007324605","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; leukemia remission; outcome assessment; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; adolescent; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; treatment outcome; flow cytometry; risk assessment; treatment planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aims of the present population-based cohort study were to assess the value of current follow-up schedules after completion of Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL protocol treatment and to estimate the impact of relapse detection mode on overall survival (OS). Among 3262 patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2014 and who completed treatment, 338 developed a relapse. Relapse detection was equally distributed between extra visits (50.8%) and scheduled follow-up visits (49.2%). All cases detected at an extra visit and 64.3% of cases detected at a scheduled visit presented with symptoms or objective findings. Neither the mode of detection {adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.48] for scheduled visits} nor the duration of symptoms was an independent risk factor for OS after relapse. The estimated number of scheduled blood samples needed to diagnose one subclinical relapse during the first 5 years after treatment cessation was 1269 (95% CI 902-1637). In conclusion, based on OS data, scheduled visits after cessation of therapy seem to yield no extra benefit.

These cells have been shown to possess strong anti-tumour efficacy both in-vitro as well as in-vivo. Objective(s): To determine if reconstitution of adaptive NK cells (CD56dimNKG2C+NKG2A-) in patients with advanced leukemia undergoing haploidentical HCT had any impact on disease progression (DP). Study Design: The study cohort comprised of 60 patients with advanced acute leukemia, aged 2-65 years, receiving myeloablative PTCy based haploidentical transplantation from CMV seropositive donors, followed by CTLA4Ig-primed donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). They were evaluated for the kinetics of reconstitution of adaptive NK cells, both phenotypic and functional, at days +30,+60, +90 and at regular intervals, to 3 years of follow-up, in relation to DP. Reconstitution of adaptive NK cells was compared with a retrospective cohort of patients in the same protocol receiving DLI without CTLA4Ig. Result(s): Non-relapse mortality, acute and chronic GVHD were 5.1%, 10.3% and 14.5%. DP was 17.5% at a median follow-up of 28 months. Adaptive NK cells were significantly higher in patients without DP at days+30, +60 and +90 (p = 0.0001), irrespective of CMV reactivation and remained elevated until 36 months post-HCT. These cells maintained their functional competence as measured by robust interferon-gamma production with higher expressions of KIR, NKG2D and CD57, without any increase in PD1 expression. Grafts from donors with higher adaptive NK cells were associated with a lower risk of DP (p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, adaptive NK cell recovery at day +90 had the most favorable impact on DP (HR-0.7). Tregs reconstituted briskly along with the adaptive NK cells and were sustained as well, without compromising the GVL effect. Comparison with a retrospective cohort receiving the same protocol with DLI without CTLA4Ig, showed a superior reconstitution of adaptive NK cells in those receiving CTLA4Ig-DLI (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that myeloablative transplantation from CMV seropositive haploidentical donors augmented with CTLA4Ig-primed DLI might favor early and sustained expansion of functionally competent adaptive NK cells irrespective of CMV reactivation, with a favorable outcome.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","144-151","","2","27","","Transplant.

A second HSCT can be a life-saving alternative, however, information on the results of such intervention in an outpatient setting is limited. Outpatient second hematoprogenitors transplant after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) at a single academic center was analyzed. Twenty-seven consecutive adults who received an allo-HSCT after an initial auto- or allo-HSCT from 2006 to 2019 were included. Data were compared using the chi2-test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models was performed; cumulative incidence estimation of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was assessed. Hodgkin lymphoma was the most frequent diagnosis for the group with a first auto-HSCT with 5/12 (41.7%) cases, and acute myeloid leukemia for those with a first allo-HSCT with 6/15 (40%). One-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) was 66.7% (95% CI 27.2-88.2) and 59% (95% CI 16-86) for 12 patients with a first auto-HSCT; and for 15 patients with a first allo-HSCT, it was 43.3% (95% CI 17.9-66.5) and 36% (95% CI 13.2-59.9), respectively. Eight (29.6%) patients died of TRM and the cumulative incidence of TRM at 1 year was 22% (95% CI 8.6-39.27). Chronic graft-versus-host disease and late (>10 months) second transplantation were protective factors for longer survival. Neutropenic fever was more common in the group with a first allo-HSCT (p = 0.01). In conclusion, outpatient second allo-HSCT using RIC after auto- or allografting failure or relapse is feasible and offers a reasonable alternative for patients with severe life-threatening hematological diseases.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","87-96","","1","39","","Hematol.

Method(s): Participants were 178 patients enrolled on a nontherapeutic clinical trial that aimed to characterize neurocognitive and functional outcomes (ie, academic achievement and adaptive skills) following treatment for childhood HR B-ALL. Eligible patients were treated on Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 clinical trial that included two treatment randomizations: methotrexate delivery (high or escalating dose) and corticosteroid (dexamethasone or prednisone). Academic achievement and adaptive skills were evaluated at one time point, 8-24 months after completing treatment. Result(s): Multivariable logistic regression showed no significant association between treatment variables and outcomes after accounting for age at diagnosis, sex, and insurance status. In multivariable analyses accounting for sex and insurance status, survivors <10 years old at diagnosis had significantly lower scores in Math (P =.02). In multivariable analyses accounting for sex and age at diagnosis, scores for children with US public health insurance were significantly lower than those with US private or military insurance across all academic and adaptive skills (all P-values <=.04). Results from univariate analyses showed that boys had significantly lower scores than girls across all adaptive skill domains (all P-values <=.04). Conclusion(s): Regardless of treatment randomization, survivors of HR B-ALL <10 years at diagnosis are at risk for deficits in Math and overall adaptive functioning; overall adaptive skills for boys were significantly poorer. Screening and early intervention for patients at highest risk, particularly young patients and lower resourced families, should be prioritized.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","e28913","","4","68","","Pediatr.

We addressed this question in a large phase III randomized trial, Myeloma XI. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (n=2,042) were randomized to induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (CTD) or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (CRD). Additional intensification therapy with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) was administered before autologous stem-cell transplantation to patients with a suboptimal response to induction therapy using a response-adapted approach. After receiving high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, eligible patients were further randomized to receive either lenalidomide alone or observation alone. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The CRD regimen was associated with significantly longer PFS (median: 36 vs. 33 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.96; P=0.0116) and OS (3-year OS: 82.9% vs. 77.0%; HR, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63-0.93; P=0.0072) compared with CTD. The PFS and OS results favored CRD over CTD across all subgroups, including patients with International Staging System stage III disease (HR for PFS, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93; HR for OS, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.56-1.09), high-risk cytogenetics (HR for PFS, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43-0.84; HR for OS, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.42-1.15) and ultra-high-risk cytogenetics (HR for PFS, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.41-1.11; HR for OS, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.34-1.25).

Optimal results for PFS and OS were achieved in the patients who received CRD induction and lenalidomide maintenance.

Mutation patterns and OS differed between the 84 patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and the 387 patients with good (n = 13), intermediate (n = 339), or unmeasured (n = 35) cytogenetic risk. TP53 (hazards ratio [HR], 2.49; P = .0003) and KRAS (HR, 3.60; P = .001) mutations independently worsened the OS of patients with poor-risk cytogenetics. In those without poor-risk cytogenetics, NPM1 (HR, 0.57; P = .0004), FLT3 internal tandem duplications with low (HR, 1.85; P = .0005) or high (HR, 3.51; P < 10-4) allelic ratio, DNMT3A (HR, 1.86; P < 10-4), NRAS (HR, 1.54; P = .019), and ASXL1 (HR, 1.89; P = .0003) mutations independently predicted OS. Combining cytogenetic risk and mutations in these 7 genes, 39.1% of patients could be assigned to a ""go-go"" tier with a 2-year OS of 66.1%, 7.6% to the ""no-go"" group (2-year OS 2.8%), and 3.3% of to the ""slow-go"" group (2-year OS of 39.1%; P < 10-5). Across 3 independent validation cohorts, 31.2% to 37.7% and 11.2% to 13.5% of patients were assigned to the go-go and the no-go tiers, respectively, with significant differences in OS between tiers in all 3 trial cohorts (HDF [Hauts-de-France], n = 141, P = .003; and SAL [Study Alliance Leukemia], n = 46; AMLSG [AML Study Group], n = 223, both P < 10-5). The ALFA decision tool is a simple, robust, and discriminant prognostic model for AML patients >=60 years of age treated with intensive chemotherapy.

However, reports on the prognostic impact of various translocations causing KMT2Ar are conflicting. Less is known about associated mutations and their prognostic impact. In a retrospective analysis, we identified 172 adult patients with KMT2Ar AML and compared them to 522 age-matched patients with diploid AML. KMT2Ar AML had fewer mutations, most commonly affecting RAS and FLT3 without significant impact on prognosis, except for patients with >=2 mutations with lower overall survival (OS). KMT2Ar AML had worse outcomes compared with diploid AML when newly diagnosed and at relapse, especially following second salvage (median OS of 2.4 vs 4.8 months, P < 0.0001). Therapy-related KMT2Ar AML (t-AML) had worse outcomes compared with de novo KMT2Ar AML (median OS of 0.7 years vs 1.4 years, P < 0.0001). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) in first remission was associated with improved OS (5-year, 52 vs 14% for no allo-HSCT, P < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, translocation subtypes causing KMT2Ar did not predict survival, unlike age and allo-HSCT. In conclusion, KMT2Ar was associated with adverse outcomes regardless of translocation subtype. Therefore, AML risk stratification guidelines should include all KMT2Ar as adverse.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","162","","9","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\KI5V24QA\Issa G.C. et al. - 2021 - Predictors of outcomes in adults with acute myeloi.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2013830311","adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; salvage therapy; outcome assessment; adolescent; cancer prognosis; fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer patient; leukemia relapse; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; cladribine/dt [Drug Therapy]; cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; idarubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; idarubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; gene mutation; CD135 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; adverse outcome; *acute myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; diploidy; gene rearrangement; clofarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Lysine Methyltransferase 2A gene; *tumor gene; Flt3 ligand/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Ras protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; survival prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In total, 990 (63%) patients were not in complete remission (CR) at the time of CBT. A myeloablative conditioning regimen (52%) and calcineurin inhibitor (CI) + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (45%) were more commonly used. With a median follow-up for survivors of 31 months, the probability of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of leukemia-related mortality at 3 years was 31% and 29%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 3 years were 24% and 41%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD at 100 days and extensive chronic GVHD at 2 years were 44%, 16%, and 14%, respectively.

Infants have shown markedly higher rates of induction mortality compared with noninfants. There are limited data on presentation acuity and supportive care utilization in this age group. Method(s): In retrospective analyses of patients treated for new onset ALL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at pediatric hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information System, we compared presentation acuity, induction mortality, and resource utilization in infants relative to noninfants less than 10 years at diagnosis. Result(s): Analyses included 10 359 children with ALL (405 infants, 9954 noninfants) and 871 AML (189 infants, 682 noninfants). Infants were more likely to present with multisystem organ failure compared to noninfants for both ALL (12% and 1%, PR = 10.8, 95% CI: 7.4, 15.7) and AML (6% vs. 3%; PR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.7). Infants with ALL had higher induction mortality compared to noninfants, even after accounting for differences in anthracycline exposure and presentation acuity (2.7% vs. 0.5%, HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0, 4.8). Conversely, infants and noninfants with AML had similar rates of induction mortality (3.2% vs. 2.1%, HR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.3, 3.9), which were comparable to rates among infants with ALL. Infants with ALL and AML had greater requirements for blood products, diuretics, supplemental oxygen, and ventilation during induction relative to noninfants.

We assessed response and overall survival (OS) in 247 patients molecularly profiled by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) before first-line HMA therapy, and a subset of 108 patients were sequenced serially during treatment. The most common mutations included TP53 (33.1%), ASXL1 (19%), TET2 (16.5%), DNMT3A (14.1%), and SRSF2 (12.1%). The overall response rate was 42.1%, with the composite TET2-mutant/ASXL1 wild-type genotype representing the strongest predictor of response (overall response rate, 62.1%; complete remission rate, 34.5%). The median OS for the cohort was 15 months, and the number of mutations detected by NGS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; P 5 .02), as well as mutations in TP53 (HR, 2.33; P 5 .001) and EZH2 (HR, 2.41; P 5 .04) were identified as independent covariates associated with inferior OS in multivariable analysis. Serial molecular profiling revealed that clearance of TP53 mutations during HMA therapy was associated with superior OS (HR, 0.28; P 5 .001) and improved outcome in patients proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Among them, lncRNA KIAA0125 is one of the genes proposed to play a critical role in leukaemia stem cell (LSC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of the expression levels of lncRNA KIAA0125 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a disease with highly heterogeneous clinical and biological features. Using RNA arrays, we measured the expression of KIAA0125 in 176 primary MDS patients. We found that higher KIAA0125 expression was associated with higher risk MDS, based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), mutations in ASXL1 and NRAS, and predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KIAA0125 expression was an independent, unfavourable prognostic factor for OS and LFS, irrespective of IPSS-R and mutation status. Further global gene expression profile analysis suggested a close association of higher KIAA0125 expressions with LSC signatures. The expression of KIAA0125 may be a potential biomarker to guide the treatment choice in MDS patients, especially those with lower risk subtypes, in whom palliative treatment is usually used.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","589-598","","3","192","","Br.

Herein, we demonstrate the functional expression of AHR in MM cell lines and primary human MM samples. AHR is expressed in putative MM 'stem cells' and advanced clinical stages of MM, and functionally contributes to MM tumor cell phenotype and proliferation. Antagonism of AHR directly impairs MM cell viability and increases MM cell susceptibility to immune-mediated clearance. Furthermore, our findings indicate that AHR antagonism may represent an effective means to enhance the function of other drugs, such as anti-CD38 antibodies, in future clinical studies. Taken together, these data identify AHR as a novel target for MM therapy.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","2968-2980","","12","62","","Leuk.

However, the effects of IKZF1 deletions co-existing genetic alterations in Ph (-) ALL have not been extensively studied. Method(s): Bone marrow samples from 368 children with Ph (-) ALL were analyzed by using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit for detection of gene deletions and Sanger sequencing for mutational analysis of RAS pathway genes. The outcome was analyzed on 215 patients treated with Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-ALL-2002 protocol. Result(s): IKZF1 deletions were present in 12.8% and IKZF1plus in 6.3% of patients. Mutations of RAS pathway genes were detected in 25.0% of IKZF1-deleted patients. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) of IKZF1-undeleted patients was significantly better compared with IKZF1-deleted patients (80.0% vs. 47.8%, p = 0.001). Compared with outcome of patients harboring IKZF1 deletion alone, no difference in EFS was observed in patients with IKZF1plus, whereas three patients carried both IKZF1 and ERG deletions had a superior 10-year EFS (100%). The 10-year EFS of patients with any gene mutation of RAS pathway was worse than that of patients with wild-type genes (79.1% vs. 61.6%, p = 0.033). In multivariate analysis, RAS pathway mutations and IKZF1 deletion were independent predictors of inferior EFS. Co-existence of IKZF1 deletion with RAS pathway mutations had a worst 10-year EFS (11.1 +/- 10.5%) and 10-year OS (53.3 +/- 17.6%).

Recent studies suggest patients who underwent post-chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (post- HSCT) would achieve durable remission and better survival, but this remains controversial. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the role of post-HSCT in R/R B-ALL. The Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed were used to identify relevant studies; the latest search update was on July 05, 2020. We used the Cochran Q test and I-squared statistics to test for heterogeneity among the studies analyzed. The fixed model and random model were used to combine results when appropriate. We performed all statistical analyses with Stata 12, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We included 18 studies with 758 patients in the meta-analysis. Our results indicated that post-HSCT was associated with lower relapse rate (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32-0.50, P = 0.000), better overall survival (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.19-0.71, P = 0.003), better leukemia-free survival (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10-0.40, P = 0.000). However, post-HSCT did not influence OS in Caucasians, and CAR-T cells with CD28 co-stimulation factor bridged to HSCT did not influence OS. Post-HSCT decreased the relapse rate and improved the long-term survival of R/R B-ALL patients. R/R B-ALL patients would benefit from post-HSCT after CAR-T cell therapy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:31","2022-09-06 19:01:31","","1003-1012","","4","100","","Ann.

It is uncertain whether consolidative haploidentical-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is suitable for achieving sustainable remission. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT. Fifty-two patients with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent haplo-HSCT after CAR-T therapy were analyzed. The median time from CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT was 61 days. After a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the 1-year probabilities of event-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse were 80.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.0-90.9), 92.3% (95% CI, 85.0-99.5), and 14.1% (95% CI, 10.7-17.4), respectively, while the corresponding 2-year probabilities were 76.0% (95% CI, 64.2-87.7), 84.3% (95% CI, 74.3-94.3), and 19.7% (95% CI, 15.3-24.0), respectively. No increased risk of 2-year cumulative incidence of graft-versus-host disease, treatment-related mortality, or infection was observed. A pre-HSCT measurable residual disease-positive status was an independent factor associated with poor overall survival (hazard radio: 4.201, 95% CI: 1.034-17.063; P = 0.045).

However, its prognostic value on MM is currently elusive. This study aimed to explore the role of PE on MM prognosis and to develop a novel prognostic nomogram for a cohort of Chinese patients with MM. Patients diagnosed with MM form 2000 through 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. PE was evaluated by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Independent predictors of overall survival (OS) were identified using a multivariable Cox regression model performed on variables selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. A nomogram was constructed based on these variables. The concordance index (C-index) and the calibration curve were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram. Among 861 patients analyzed, 368 patients developed PE. Multivariate cox regression and restricted mean survival time (RMST) analyses revealed that patients with PE experienced worse OS vs. patients without PE. A nomogram predictive of OS was constructed using PE, plasma cell proportion, international staging system (ISS) stage, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 1q21 gain, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The nomogram showed satisfactory discrimination in the derivation cohort (C-index=0.729) and the validation cohort (C-index=0.684), outperforming the Durie-Salmon (DS) and ISS staging systems. Moreover, the nomogram accurately classified patients into two distinct high- and low-risk groups. PE is frequently encountered in the disease course for MM patients. We derivated and validated a novel nomogram for MM based on PE, outperforming the DS/ISS staging systems.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","1789-1801","","7","100","","Ann.

Various models of NK cell alloreactivity have been associated with outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), but results have varied widely. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the context of KIR profiles may further refine their association with transplant outcomes. In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, 81 AML patients who underwent matched-related donor alloHCT were included. Post-HCT outcomes were assessed based on mutational status and KIR profiles with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. On multivariable analysis those with any somatic mutations and C1/C2 heterozygosity had less acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.75; P =.009), more relapse (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.30-7.01; P =.010), inferior relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P =.014), and overall survival (OS; HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P =.015), whereas those with a missing KIR ligand had superior RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94; P =.031). The presence of a somatic mutation and donor haplotype A was also associated with less acute GvHD (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92; P =.032), more relapse (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.13-6.52; P =.025), inferior RFS (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14; P =.030), and OS (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.38; P =.024). Enhanced NK cell alloreactivity from more KIR activating signals (donor B haplotype) and fewer inhibitory signals (recipient missing KIR ligand or C1 or C2 homozygosity) may help mitigate the adverse prognosis associated with some AML somatic mutations.

The value of MRD after treatment with decitabine in older patients is unknown. This retrospective analysis included patients >=60 years of age with AML who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) after treatment with decitabine or intensive chemotherapy. Of the 133 consecutively transplanted patients, 109 had available pretransplantation MRD analyses (by flowcytometry [threshold 0.1%]). Forty patients received decitabine treatment (10-day schedule), and 69 patients received intensive chemotherapy (7 + 3 regimen). Patients who received decitabine were older (median 67 versus 64 years) and more often had MRD (70% versus 38%). OS after alloHCT was comparable in both groups. In the chemotherapy group, MRD-positive patients had a significantly higher relapse probability (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 4.81; P=.0031) and risk of death (HR 2.8; P=.02) compared to MRD-negative patients. In the decitabine group there was no significant association between the presence of MRD and relapse (sHR 0.85; P=.83) or death (HR 0.72; P=.60). Pretransplantation MRD in patients receiving decitabine treatment does not have similar predictive value for relapse or survival in older AML patients receiving an alloHCT, compared to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","246-252","","3","27","","Transplant.

We evaluated the prognostic role of clonal hematopoiesis-associated DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (DTA) and non-DTA mutations for MRD monitoring post-alloHCT to refine MRD marker selection. Of 154 patients with AML, 138 (90%) had at least one mutation at diagnosis, which were retrospectively monitored by amplicon-based error-corrected NGS on day 90 and/or day 180 post-alloHCT. MRD was detected in 34 patients on day 90 and/or day 180 (25%). The rate of MRD positivity was similar when DTA and non-DTA mutations were considered separately (17.6% vs 19.8%). DTA mutations had no prognostic impact on cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, or overall survival in our study and were removed from further analysis. In the remaining 131 patients with at least 1 non-DTA mutation, clinical and transplantation-associated characteristics were similarly distributed between MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients. In multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was an independent adverse predictor of cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, and overall survival but not of nonrelapse mortality. The prognostic effect was independent of different cutoffs (above limit of detection, 0.1% and 1% variant allele frequency). MRD log-reduction between diagnosis and post-alloHCT assessment had no prognostic value. MRD status post-alloHCT had the strongest impact in patients who were MRD positive prior to alloHCT. In conclusion, non-DTA mutations are prognostic NGS-MRD markers post-alloHCT, whereas the prognostic role of DTA mutations in the posttransplant setting remains open.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","2294-2304","","9","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology AllPrep DNA/RNA: Qiagen, MiSeq: Illumina","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\CTIS9U3P\Heuser M. et al. - 2021 - Posttransplantation MRD monitoring in patients wit.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012115898","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; human cell; mortality; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer prognosis; multivariate analysis; incidence; allele; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; cytogenetics; multiple cycle treatment; *gene mutation; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNMT3A gene; TET2 gene; clinical feature; genetic analyzer; high throughput sequencer; *patient monitoring; *high throughput sequencing; *minimal residual disease/di [Diagnosis]; ASXL1 gene; gene frequency; bioinformatics; antileukemic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; bioinformatics software; antileukemic agent/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *cancer patient; amplicon; *acute myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; gene function; leukemia relapse/di [Diagnosis]; limit of detection; marker gene; molecular diagnosis; nucleic acid isolation kit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the time of analysis, 90% of patients had died, with the longest follow-up since randomization 36 months. The combination of glasdegib and LDAC conferred superior overall survival (OS) versus LDAC alone; hazard ratio (HR) 0.495; (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.325-0.752); p = 0.0004; median OS was 8.3 versus 4.3 months. Improvement in OS was consistent across cytogenetic risk groups.

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P <.001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax +/- anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels >=550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels >=40 mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment.

While mutational status of IGHV is stable, cytogenetic aberrations frequently evolve. However, the relationships of these features as prognosticators at diagnosis are unknown. We examined the CpG-stimulated metaphase cytogenetic features detected within 1 year of diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and correlated these features with outcome and other clinical features including IGHV mutational status. Of 329 untreated patients, 53 (16.1%) had a complex karyotype, and 85 (25.8%) had a translocation. The median time to first treatment (TFT) was 47 months. In univariable analyses, significant risk factors for shorter TFT (P<0.05) were Rai stage 3-4, b2-microglobulin >3.5 mg/L, log-transformed white blood cell count, unmutated IGHV, a complex karyotype, a translocation, and trisomy 8, del(11q) or del(17p) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In multivariable analysis, there was a significant effect modification of IGHV status on the relationship between translocation and TFT (P=0.002). In IGHV-mutated patients, those with a translocation had an over 3.5 times higher risk of starting treatment than those without a translocation (P<0.001); however, among IGHV-unmutated patients, a translocation did not significantly increase the risk of starting treatment (hazard ratio 1.00, P=0.99). The effect of Rai stage 3-4, log-transformed white blood cell count and complex karyotype remained statistically significant, whereas that of del(17p) did not (P=0.51). In summary, the presence of a translocation in IGHV-mutated patients appeared to negate the improved prognosis of mutated IGHV, but the presence of a translocation did not have an effect on TFT in high-risk IGHV-unmutated patients.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","1608-1615","","6","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\LQSZTQYP\Heerema N.A. et al. - 2021 - Prognostic significance of translocations in the p.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012854404","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; karyotype; *cytogenetics; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetic association; leukocyte count; *cancer prognosis; chromosome aberration; chromosome analysis; beta 2 microglobulin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; trisomy 8; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; *gene translocation; *immunoglobulin heavy chain/ec [Endogenous Compound]; gene rearrangement; oncogene myc; partial trisomy 3; protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; protein c Myb/ec [Endogenous Compound]; trisomy 12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isolated extramedullary (EM) relapse (iEMR) after HSCT is relatively rare and not well characterized, particularly in pediatric patients. We retrospectively analyzed 1527 consecutive pediatric patients with acute leukemia after allo-HSCT to study the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of iEMR compared with systemic relapse. The 5-year cumulative incidence of systemic relapse (either bone marrow [BM] only or BM combined with EMR) was 24.8%, and that of iEMR was 5.5%. The onset of relapse after allo-HSCT was significantly longer in EM sites than in BM sites (7.19 and 5.58 months, respectively; P =.013). Complete response (CR) 2+/active disease at transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; P <.001) and prior EM disease (HR, 2.3; P =.007) were independent risk factors for iEMR. Chronic graft-versus-host disease reduced the risk of systemic relapse (HR, 0.5; P =.043) but did not protect against iEMR. The prognosis of patients who developed iEMR remained poor but was slightly better than that of patients who developed systemic relapse (3-year overall survival, 16.5% versus 15.3%; P =.089). Patients experiencing their first systemic relapse continued to have further systemic relapse, but only a minority progressed to iEMR, whereas those experiencing their iEMR at first relapse developed further systemic relapse and iEMR at approximately similar frequencies. A second iEMR was more common after a first iEMR than after a first systemic relapse (58.8% versus 13.0%; P =.001) and was associated with poor outcome. iEMR has a poor prognosis, particularly after a second relapse, and effective strategies are needed to improve outcomes.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","859.e1-859.e10","","10","27","","Transplant.

The phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial (NCT02990338) showed that isatuximab plus pomalidomide-dexamethasone prolongs median progression-free survival (mPFS) in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). This subgroup analysis of ICARIA-MM compared the benefit of isatuximab in high-risk [defined by the presence of del(17p), t(4;14) or t(14;16)] versus standard-risk patients. The efficacy of isatuximab in patients with gain(1q21) abnormality was also assessed in a retrospective subgroup analysis. In ICARIA-MM, 307 patients received isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (n = 154) or pomalidomide-dexamethasone (n = 153). Isatuximab (10 mg/kg intravenously) was given weekly in the first 28-day cycle, and every other week thereafter. Standard pomalidomide-dexamethasone doses were given. Isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone improved mPFS (7.5 vs 3.7 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28) and overall response rate (ORR, 50.0% vs 16.7%) in high-risk patients. In patients with isolated gain(1q21), isatuximab addition improved mPFS (11.2 vs 4.6 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.88) and ORR (53.6% vs 27.6%). More grade >=3 adverse events occurred in high-risk patients receiving isatuximab (95.7%) versus the control group (67.6%); however, isatuximab did not increase events leading to discontinuation or treatment-related mortality. Isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone provides a consistent benefit over pomalidomide-dexamethasone treatment in RRMM patients regardless of cytogenetic risk.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is not well established. We examined the effect of 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on alloHCT outcomes of AML. We included 500 adult (>=18 years) AML patients in first (n = 370) or second (n = 130) complete remission receiving alloHCT from 2005 to 2016. Patients were classified into favorable (12%), intermediate (57%), and adverse (32%) 2017 ELN risk groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to conduct the multivariable analyses of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). Relapse and nonrelapse mortality were analyzed by the Fine-Gray regression model. OS at 2 years was 72% in the favorable versus 60% in the intermediate versus 45% in the adverse risk groups (P <.001). In multivariable analyses, the 2017 ELN classifier was an independent predictor of OS after alloHCT with significantly higher overall mortality in the intermediate (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.68; P =.03) and adverse (HR = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.54-4.06; P <.001) risk groups compared to the favorable risk group. Similarly, LFS was worse in the intermediate (HR = 1.63, 95%, CI 1.06-2.53; P =.03) and adverse (HR 2.23, 95% CI, 1.41-3.54; P <.001) risk groups while relapse was higher in the adverse risk group (HR = 2.36, 95% CI, 1.28-4.35; P =.006) as compared to the favorable risk group. These data highlight the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on the survival of AML patients after alloHCT. Patients in the adverse risk group had the highest risk of relapse and worst survival. Thus the 2017 ELN prognostic system can help identify AML patients who may benefit from clinical trials offering relapse mitigation strategies to improve transplant outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","256.e1-256.e7","","3","27","","Transplant.

However,;40% of patients relapse, and the literature suggests that patients with inv(16) fare differently from those with t(8;21). We retrospectively analyzed 537 patients with CBF-AML, focusing on additional cytogenetic aberrations to examine their impact on clinical outcomes. Trisomies of chromosomes 8, 21, or 22 were significantly more common in patients with inv(16)/t(16;16): 16% vs 7%, 6% vs 0%, and 17% vs 0%, respectively. In contrast, del(9q) and loss of a sex chromosome were more frequent in patients with t(8;21): 15% vs 0.4% for del(9q), 37% vs 0% for loss of X in females, and 44% vs 5% for loss of Y in males.

In multivariable analyses (adjusted for age, white blood counts at diagnosis, and KIT mutation status), trisomy 8 was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in inv(16), whereas the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities (not trisomy 8) was associated with decreased OS. In patients with t(8;21), hypodiploidy was associated with improved disease-free survival; hyperdiploidy and del(9q) were associated with improved OS.

The impact of locus of care (LOC; adult vs pediatric) in this population is unknown. Procedure: The IMPACT cohort comprises detailed data for all Ontario, Canada, AYA aged 15-21 years diagnosed with AML between 1992 and 2012, linked to population-based health administrative data. We determined the impact of LOC on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), treatment-related mortality (TRM), and relapse/progression. Result(s): Among 140 AYA, 51 (36.4%) received therapy at pediatric centers. The five-year EFS and OS for the whole cohort were 35.0% +/- 4.0% and 53.6% +/- 4.2%. Cumulative doses of anthracycline were higher among pediatric center AYA [median 355 mg/m2, interquartile range (IQR) 135-492 vs 202 mg/m2, IQR 140-364; P = 0.003]. In multivariable analyses, LOC was not predictive of either EFS [adult vs pediatric center hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-2.2, P = 0.27] or OS (HR 1.0, CI 0.6-1.6, P = 0.97). However, patterns of treatment failure varied; higher two-year incidence of TRM in pediatric centers (23.5% +/- 6.0% vs.10.1% +/- 3.2%; P = 0.046) was balanced by lower five-year incidence of relapse/progression (33.3% +/- 6.7% vs 56.2% +/- 5.3%; P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): AYA AML survival outcomes did not vary between pediatric and adult settings. Causes of treatment failure were different, with higher intensity pediatric protocols associated with higher TRM but lower relapse/progression. Careful risk stratification and enhanced supportive care may be of substantial benefit to AYA with AML by allocating maximal treatment intensity to patients who most benefit while minimizing the risk of TRM.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","e28939","","8","68","","Pediatr.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has acquired unprecedented efficacy in B-cell malignancies, but its role in the long-term survival of r/r Ph+ ALL patients is unclear. We analyzed the effect of CART on 56 adults with r/r Ph+ ALL who accepted split doses of humanized CD19-targeted CART after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 51/56 (91.1%) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with inadequate count recovery (CRi), including 38 patients with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) tested by bone marrow BCR-ABL1 copies. Subsequently, 30/51 CR/CRi patients accepted consolidative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Their outcomes were compared with those of 21/51 contemporaneous patients without alloHSCT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of CR/CRi patients with alloHSCT were significantly superior to those without alloHSCT (58.9%, CI 49.8-68.0% vs. 22.7%, CI 12.7-32.7%, p = 0.005; 53.2%, CI 43.6-62.8% vs. 18.8%, CI 9.2-28.4%, p = 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that alloHSCT and MRD-negative post-CART were the independent prognostic factors for OS and LFS. CART therapy is highly effective for r/r Ph+ ALL patients, and consolidative alloHSCT could prolong their OS and LFS.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:32","2022-09-06 19:01:32","","91-100","","1","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\9B2ZVAGS\Gu B. et al. - 2021 - Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantatio.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2005291750","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; article; comparative study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; human cell; adolescent; cancer prognosis; priority journal; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer specific survival; *aging; *leukemia relapse; *leukemia remission; *treatment outcome; minimal residual disease; *CD19 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; *Philadelphia chromosome positive cell; BCR ABL1 gene; fusion gene; gene dosage; therapy effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All transplantations used reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Total-body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was the predominant regimen for HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was uniformly posttransplantation cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, and mycophenolate. Fludarabine with busulfan or melphalan was the predominant regimen for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT, and GVHD prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor with mycophenolate or methotrexate. Results of multivariate analysis revealed higher relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P 5 .0055; 2-year relapse rate, 48% vs 33%) and lower disease-free survival (DFS) rates after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT (HR, 1.29; P 5 .042; 2-year DFS, 29% vs 36%). However, overall survival (OS) rates did not differ between donor type (HR, 0.94; P 5 .65; 2-year OS, 46% for HLA-haploidentical and 44% for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT) because of mortality associated with chronic GVHD. Acute grade 2 to 4 GVHD (HR, 0.44; P , .0001) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.36; P , .0001) were lower after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT. By 2 years, probability of death resulting from chronic GVHD was lower after HLA-haploidentical relative compared with HLAmatched unrelated donor HCT (6% vs 21%), negating any potential survival advantage from better relapse control.

However, results remain inferior to children with ALL. The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) ALL06 study (anzctr.org.au/ ACTRN12611000814976) was designed to assess whether a pediatric ALL regimen (Australian and New Zealand Children's Haematology and Oncology Group [ANZCHOG] Study 8) could be administered to patients aged 15 to 39 years in a comparable time frame to children as assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction/ consolidation and commencing the next phase of therapy (protocol M or high-risk [HR] treatment) by day 94. Minimal residual disease (MRD) response stratified patients to HR treatment and transplantation. From 2012 to 2018, a total of 86 patients were enrolled; 82 were eligible. Median age was 22 years (range, 16-38 years). Induction/consolidation was equally deliverable in ALL06 as in Study 8. In ALL06, 41.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7-52.9) commenced protocol M or HR therapy by day 94 vs 39.3% in Study 8 (P = .77). Median time to protocol M/HR treatment was 96 days (interquartile range, 87.5-103 days) in ALL06 vs 98 days in Study 8 (P = .80). Induction mortality was 3.6%. With a median follow-up of 44 months (1-96 months), estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 72.8% (95% CI, 62.8-82.7), and estimated 3-year overall survival was 74.9% (95% CI, 65.3-84.5). End induction/consolidation MRD negativity rate was 58.6%. Body mass index >=30 kg/m2 and day 79 MRD positivity were associated with poorer disease-free survival and overall survival. Pediatric therapy was safe and as deliverable in AYA patients as in children with ALL. Intolerance of pediatric ALL induction/consolidation is not a major contributor to inferior outcomes in AYA ALL.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:33","2022-09-06 19:01:33","","5574-5583","","24","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\MHJ3TC69\Greenwood M. et al. - 2021 - An MRD-stratified pediatric protocol is as deliver.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2016368672","adult; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; mortality; adolescent; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/po [Oral Drug Administration]; follow up; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; treatment duration; treatment response; clinical outcome; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; time to treatment; induction chemotherapy; drug megadose; *minimal residual disease; maintenance therapy; disease free survival; body mass; mercaptopurine/dt [Drug Therapy]; prednisone/dt [Drug Therapy]; consolidation chemotherapy; *age; mercaptopurine/cb [Drug Combination]; methotrexate/tl [Intrathecal Drug Administration]; *adolescent health; *antineoplastic protocol; drug hypersensitivity; recombinant asparaginase/dt [Drug Therapy]; recombinant asparaginase/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration]; recombinant asparaginase/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated frequency and factors associated with RTW in a cohort of patients younger than 66 years, with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), uniformly treated with a bortezomib-based induction followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Socio-economic and working status data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. One hundred and eighty-six patients entered the study. Of whom, 145 (78%) where employed at diagnosis, which was more frequent in younger (median 55 vs. 60 years, p < 0.001), men (59.3% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.004), and with college studies (44.8% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.008). Forty-three (30%) of the 145 patients who had a job at diagnosis, RTW after ASCT in a median of 5 (range 1-27) months. Factors independently associated with RTW were having three or more children (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.33-6.18), college studies (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.21-6.41), and a family income >40 x 103/year (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.12-4.78).

We investigated relapse risk following suboptimal asparaginase exposure among 1401 children aged 1 to 17 years, diagnosed with ALL between July 2008 and February 2016, treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol (including extended asparaginase exposure [1000 IU/m2 intramuscularly weeks 5-33]). Patients were included with delayed entry at their last administered asparaginase treatment, or detection of SI, and followed until relapse, death, secondary malignancy, or end of follow-up (median, 5.71 years; interquartile range, 4.02-7.64). In a multiple Cox model comparing patients with (n = 358) and without (n = 1043) truncated asparaginase treatment due to clinical toxicity, the adjusted relapse-specific hazard ratio (HR; aHR) was 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-2.06; P = .20). In a substudy including only patients with information on enzyme activity (n = 1115), the 7-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the 301 patients with truncation of asparaginase treatment or SI (157 hypersensitivity, 53 pancreatitis, 14 thrombosis, 31 other, 46 SI) was 11.1% (95% CI, 6.9-15.4) vs 6.7% (95% CI, 4.7-8.6) for the 814 remaining patients.

The relative value of transplantation with MUD vs Haplo donors when both groups receive PTCy/calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis is not known. We compared outcomes after 2036 Haplo and 284 MUD transplantations with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in adults from 2011 through 2018. Cox regression models were built to compare outcomes between donor types. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens were analyzed separately. Among recipients of reduced-intensity regimens, 2-year graft failure (3% vs 11%), acute grades 2 to 4 GVHD (hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; P = .022), acute grades 3 and 4 GVHD (HR, 0.41; P = .016), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.43; P = .0008) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. Consequently, disease-free (HR, 0.74; P = .008; 55% vs 41%) and overall (HR, 0.65; P = .001; 67% vs 54%) survival were higher with MUD than with Haplo transplants. Among recipients of myeloablative regimens, day-100 platelet recovery (95% vs 88%) was higher and grades 3 and 4 acute (HR, 0.39; P = .07) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.66; P = .05) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. There were no differences in graft failure, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and disease-free and overall survival between donor types with myeloablative conditioning regimens. These data extend and confirm the importance of donor-recipient HLA matching for allogeneic transplantation. A MUD is the preferred donor, especially for transplantations with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:33","2022-09-06 19:01:33","","273-282","","3","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\5CRMX8HR\Gooptu M. et al. - 2021 - HLA-haploidentical vs matched unrelated donor tran.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2013685902","*cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; absolute neutrophil count; adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; *haploidentical transplantation; acute graft versus host disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; acute graft versus host disease/pc [Prevention]; acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; chronic graft versus host disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; chronic graft versus host disease/pc [Prevention]; leukemia remission; mycophenolic acid/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer survival; middle aged; myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; busulfan/dt [Drug Therapy]; whole body radiation; *graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; *graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; follow up; *cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; *cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *haploidentical donor; *matched unrelated donor; calcineurin inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination]; calcineurin inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer mortality; comorbidity; *myeloablative conditioning; *reduced intensity conditioning; busulfan/cb [Drug Combination]; fludarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; HLA matching; leukemia relapse; melphalan/cb [Drug Combination]; human tissue; donor lymphocyte infusion; observational study; mortality risk; disease free survival; cause of death; graft failure; neutrophil; infection; *prophylaxis; disease risk assessment; *graft versus host reaction/rt [Radiotherapy]; acute graft versus host disease/rt [Radiotherapy]; allotransplantation; chronic graft versus host disease/rt [Radiotherapy]; combination drug therapy; interstitial pneumonia; low-dose radiotherapy; thiotepa/cb [Drug Combination]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Response-adapted treatment may decrease this risk by reducing exposure to therapy associated with SMN risk. The Children's Oncology Group study AHOD0031 evaluated response-adapted therapy for children and adolescents with intermediate-risk HL. We report the SMNs among 1711 patients enrolled in AHOD0031. Patients were treated with 4 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide with or without involved-field radiation therapy (RT). Patients with a slow early response to initial chemotherapy were randomized to 2 additional cycles of dexamethasone, etoposide, cisplatin and cytarabine or no additional chemotherapy, and all received RT. At a median follow-up of 7.3 years, an analysis of SMNs was performed. The 10-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.0). SMNs included 3 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 11 with solid tumors, and 3 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Sixteen of 17 patients with an SMN had received combined modality therapy. The standardized incidence ratio for SMN was 9.5 (95% CI, 4.5-15.2) with an excess absolute risk of 1.2 per 1000 person-years. The cumulative incidence of SMNs was higher among patients who received RT (P =.037). In multivariate analysis, RT, B symptoms, and race were associated with SMN risk. Given the latency from exposure, we have likely captured all cases of secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Longer follow-up is needed to determine the risk of solid tumors. Avoidance of RT without sacrificing disease control should remain a goal for future therapeutic approaches. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00025259., Key Points: * Among 1711 children with HL treated on the COG AHOD0031 trial, the 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancy is 1.32%. * The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary MDS/AML is 0.2%, which is similar to that observed with other HL therapies.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:33","2022-09-06 19:01:33","","1449-1456","","11","137","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\IS67ACX4\Giulino-Roth L. et al. - 2021 - Subsequent malignant neoplasms among children with.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011400188","article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; adolescent; child; acute myeloid leukemia; priority journal; follow up; cancer incidence; cancer combination chemotherapy; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; risk factor; myelodysplastic syndrome; cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; etoposide/cb [Drug Combination]; etoposide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer risk; multiple cycle treatment; dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; dexamethasone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; etoposide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cytarabine/ct [Clinical Trial]; cytarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; randomized controlled trial; prednisone/dt [Drug Therapy]; prednisone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; vincristine/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination]; cisplatin/dt [Drug Therapy]; doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; prednisone/cb [Drug Combination]; vincristine/cb [Drug Combination]; doxorubicin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cancer radiotherapy; ethnicity; *Hodgkin disease; *malignant neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy]; *malignant neoplasm/rt [Radiotherapy]; *subsequent malignant neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy]; *subsequent malignant neoplasm/rt [Radiotherapy]; bleomycin/cb [Drug Combination]; bleomycin/ct [Clinical Trial]; bleomycin/dt [Drug Therapy]; bleomycin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy]; cisplatin/ct [Clinical Trial]; cisplatin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cyclophosphamide/ct [Clinical Trial]; dexamethasone/ct [Clinical Trial]; doxorubicin/ct [Clinical Trial]; embryonal carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; etoposide/ct [Clinical Trial]; mucoepidermoid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy]; multimodality cancer therapy; mycosis fungoides/dt [Drug Therapy]; osteosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; parotid gland carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; positron emission tomography; prednisone/ct [Clinical Trial]; race difference; renal cell carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; secondary acute myeloid leukemia; standardized incidence ratio; synovial sarcoma; T cell lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; testis carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; thyroid papillary carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/ct [Clinical Trial]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether cause-specific mortality has changed with time remains unclear. We examined late cause-specific mortality among patients with MM receiving aPBSCT from 1989 to 2014. We conducted a prospective cohort study using participants enrolled in the enrolled in the Blood or Marrow Transplant Survivor Study. We created 3 eras to reflect changing MM therapy: <2000 (pre-thalidomide); 2000-2005 (thalidomide); 2006-2014 (lenalidomide). We used Kaplan-Meier techniques and Cox regression for examining all-cause mortality, and subdistribution hazards models for cause-specific mortality. In total, 1906 patients were followed up for a median of 9.2 years. Conditional on surviving 2 years, the 10-year overall survival was 45%. The 10-year cumulative incidence of myeloma- and non-myeloma-related mortality was 33% and 13%, respectively.

Studies examining factors that cause early death (ED; within 30 days of admission) and the correlation of survival with the timing of administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and hemostatic parameters are scarce. We performed a cohort analysis of nonselect patients with newly diagnosed APL who presented to the health care system in Hong Kong, where oral arsenic trioxide was used. From 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2020, 358 patients (median age, 47 [1-97] years) with newly diagnosed APL were identified. ED occurred in 56 patients (16%): 11 (3%) died in the first 2 days after admission (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], n = 6; APLdifferentiation syndrome [APL-DS], n 5 4; infection, n = 1); 22 (6%) died within 3 to 7 days (ICH, n = 12; APL-DS, n = 8; infections, n = 2), and 23 (6%) died within 8 to 30 days (ICH, n = 7; APL-DS, n = 11; infection, n = 5). Factors significantly associated with ED by multivariate analysis included male sex (P = .01); presenting leukocyte count >=10 x 109/ L (P = .03); fibrinogen <1.5 g/L (P = .02); and ATRA administration >24 hours after hospital admission (P < .001). After a median follow-up of 47 (0-166) months, the 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 68.6% and 61.2%, respectively. Excluding EDs, the 5- and 10-year post-30-day OS improved to 81.3% and 72.5%. Early administration of ATRA (<24 hours) and vigorous correction of hemostatic abnormalities, including hypofibrinogenemia, are key to reducing ED.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

Ninety-five patients transplanted in first (n = 75) or second (n = 20) complete remission (CR) from either HLA-matched sibling (n = 32), unrelated (n = 47) or haploidentical (n = 16) donor were included in the analysis.

In this retrospective study, we compared two ""reduced-toxicity"" regimens: intravenous busulfan at a total dose of 9.6 mg/kg (3 days) + fludarabine (Bu3/Flu) and total body irradiation at a dose of 8 Gy + fludarabine (TBI8Gy/Flu). In the entire study cohort (n = 518), the probabilities of overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years for Bu3/Flu and TBI8Gy/Flu were 62% vs. 72.5% (p = 0.051), 59.5% vs. 65% (p = 0.15), 30% vs. 20% (p = 0.01), and 10% vs. 14% (p = 0.18), respectively. In multivariate model for patients <50 years old, TBI8Gy/Flu was associated with improved LFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, p = 0.04), OS (HR = 0.31, p = 0.004), and survival free from both graft-versus-host disease and relapse (HR = 0.55, p = 0.03), as well as tendency to reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.53, p = 0.08). Among patients aged 50 years or older the use of TBI8Gy/Flu was associated with increased incidence of NRM (HR = 3.9, p = 0.0009), with no significant impact on other outcome measures.

Telomere length measured in leukocytes (LTL) has been investigated in different cancer types, including multiple myeloma (MM). However, LTL measurement is prone to heterogeneity due to sample handling and study design (retrospective vs. prospective). LTL is genetically determined; genome-wide association studies identified 11 SNPs that, combined in a score, can be used as a genetic instrument to measure LTL and evaluate its association with MM risk. This approach has been already successfully attempted in various cancer types but never in MM. We tested the ""teloscore"" in 2407 MM patients and 1741 controls from the International Multiple Myeloma rESEarch (IMMeNSE) consortium. We observed an increased risk for longer genetically determined telomere length (gdTL) (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.36-2.11; P = 2.97 x 10-6 for highest vs. lowest quintile of the score). Furthermore, in a subset of 1376 MM patients we tested the relationship between the teloscore and MM patients survival, observing a better prognosis for longer gdTL compared with shorter gdTL (HR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.86-0.99; P = 0.049). In conclusion, we report convincing evidence that longer gdTL is a risk marker for MM risk, and that it is potentially involved in increasing MM survival.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:34","2022-09-06 19:01:34","","74","","4","11","","Blood Cancer J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\NHYDF5AA\Giaccherini M. et al. - 2021 - Genetically determined telomere length and multipl.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011171969","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; allele; International Staging System; *multiple myeloma; survival analysis; risk assessment; expression quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; *telomere length; binding site; computer model; genome-wide association study; Mendelian randomization analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce the bias between the groups, we performed a 1:1 propensity score matching technique for analysis and found that patients with deep and partial immunoparesis also had shorter OS and PFS. Our study showed that deep and partial immunoparesis can be defined an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with newly diagnosed MM.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:34","2022-09-06 19:01:34","","883-890","","4","62","","Leuk.

This leukemia is characterized by a single-copy deletion of the IKZF1 (IKAROS) tumor suppressor and increased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This identifies mTOR as an attractive therapeutic target in HR B-ALL. Here, we report that IKAROS represses MTOR transcription and IKAROS' ability to repress MTOR in leukemia is impaired by oncogenic CK2 kinase. Treatment with the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, enhances IKAROS activity as a repressor of MTOR, resulting in reduced expression of MTOR in HR B-ALL. Thus, we designed a novel therapeutic approach that implements dual targeting of mTOR: direct inhibition of the mTOR protein (with rapamycin), in combination with IKAROS-mediated transcriptional repression of the MTOR gene (using the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945). Combination treatment with rapamycin and CX-4945 shows synergistic therapeutic effects in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts from Hispanic/Latino children with HR B-ALL. These data suggest that such therapy has the potential to reduce the health disparity in HR B-ALL among Hispanic/Latino children. The dual targeting of oncogene transcription, combined with inhibition of the corresponding oncoprotein provides a paradigm for a novel precision medicine approach for treating hematological malignancies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:34","2022-09-06 19:01:34","","1267-1278","","5","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\2P83F58H\Ge Z. et al. - 2021 - Dual targeting of MTOR as a novel therapeutic appr.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2010324727","article; controlled study; female; human; human cell; rapamycin/cb [Drug Combination]; rapamycin/dt [Drug Therapy]; nonhuman; priority journal; gene expression; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; high risk patient; drug efficacy; Hispanic; clinical article; health disparity; synergistic effect; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/et [Etiology]; *mammalian target of rapamycin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *molecularly targeted therapy; *MTOR gene; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; casein kinase II/ec [Endogenous Compound]; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene repression; genetic transcription; Ikaros transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]; in vitro study; mouse; oncogene; personalized medicine; rapamycin/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]; silmitasertib/cb [Drug Combination]; silmitasertib/dt [Drug Therapy]; silmitasertib/po [Oral Drug Administration]; tumor xenograft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This retrospective study summarized data from 11 consecutive Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed AML. In all, 3240 patients with AML were analyzed, and 36 (1.11%) were found to have CNS involvement at diagnosis. The incidence of CNS disease among the 5 studies with per protocol mandatory lumbar puncture (LP) was similar to the incidence among studies in which LP was performed at the discretion of the investigator (0.86% vs 1.41%; P 5 .18). There was no significant difference in the rate of complete remission (CR) among patients with CNS involvement and those with other extramedullary disease (EMD) sites or those with no EMD (52.8% vs 59.3%-60%). The median overall survival (OS) for patients who were CNS positive, who had other EMD, or who had no EMD was 11.4, 11.3, and 12.7 months, respectively. There was no difference in OS among patients with CNS involvement, those with other EMD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; adjusted P 5 .84), and those with no EMD (HR, 1.19; adjusted P 5 .44). In conclusion, the reported incidence of CNS involvement in patients with newly diagnosed AML is low (1.1%), irrespective of whether an LP is mandatory or not. The presence of CNS disease at diagnosis in and of itself does not seem to portend a poor prognosis for achieving an initial CR or for OS.Copyright s 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Quizartinib, a once-daily oral, highly potent, and selective FLT3 inhibitor, significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and improved clinical benefit compared with salvage chemotherapy (median OS, 6.2 months versus 4.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], .58 to .98; P = .018; composite complete remission [CRc] rate, 48% versus 27%; median duration of CRc, 2.8 months versus 1.2 months; mortality rate, .8% versus 14% by day 30, 7% versus 24% by day 60) in patients with R/R FLT3-ITD AML in the phase 3 QuANTUM-R trial. In this post hoc analysis, we described the characteristics of and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent on-study HSCT in QuANTUM-R at the investigator's discretion and institutional practices. Of 367 randomized patients, 78 (32%) in the quizartinib arm and 14 (11%) in the salvage chemotherapy arm underwent on-study allo-HSCT without any intervening therapy for AML after quizartinib or study-specified salvage chemotherapy. Pooled data of patients from both treatment arms showed a longer median overall survival (OS) in transplant recipients versus those treated without allo-HSCT (12.2 months versus 4.4 months; HR, .315; 95% CI, .233 to .427). Pooled data also showed a longer median OS in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT versus patients without a CRc (20.1 months versus 8.8 months; HR, .506; 95% CI, .296 to .864). By treatment arm, the median OS was 25.1 months with quizartinib and 20.1 months with salvage chemotherapy in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT. Forty-eight patients in the quizartinib arm continued quizartinib treatment after allo-HSCT. In the 31 patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT who continued quizartinib after allo-HSCT, the median OS was 27.1 months. Continuation of quizartinib after allo-HSCT was tolerable, and no new safety signals were identified. These results suggest that post-transplantation survival following salvage chemotherapy and quizartinib treatment are similar. However, quizartinib response occurs more frequently than with salvage chemotherapy, potentially allowing more patients to undergo transplantation and achieve durable clinical benefit. In addition, post-transplant quizartinib was found to be tolerable and may be associated with prolonged survival in some patients, highlighting its potential value in the management of patients with FLT3-ITD R/R AML.

Stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment option, and patient selection is critical because of relevant transplant-related morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the impact of mutation status together with clinical presentations on posttransplant outcome. Our study included 240 patients with a median follow-up of 5.5 years. A significant association with worse survival was identified for the presence of mutations in ASXL1 and/or NRAS. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), marrow blasts.2% (HR, 1.70), and increasing comorbidity index (continuous HR, 1.16) were independently associated with worse survival. A prognostic score (CMML transplant score) was developed, and the following points were assigned: 4 points for an ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype or blasts.2% and 1 point each for an increase of 1 in the comorbidity index. The CMML transplant score (range, 0-20) was predictive of survival and nonrelapse mortality (P,.001 for both). Up to 5 risk groups were identified, showing 5-year survival of 81% for a score of 0 to 1, 49% for a score of 2 to 4, 43% for a score of 5 to 7, 31% for a score of 8 to 10, and 19% for a score.10. The score retained performance after validation (concordance index, 0.68) and good accuracy after calibration. Predictions were superior compared with existing scores designed for the nontransplant setting, which resulted in significant risk reclassification. This CMML transplant score, which incorporated mutation and clinical information, was prognostic in patients specifically undergoing transplantation and may facilitate personalized counseling.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:34","2022-09-06 19:01:34","","1760-1769","","6","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\TFVU96VT\Gagelmann N. et al. - 2021 - A prognostic score including mutation profile and .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011480287","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; cancer survival; follow up; cancer mortality; comorbidity; cancer patient; *clinical feature; hazard ratio; *gene mutation; genotype; gene; *cancer prognosis; bone marrow; *ASXL1 gene; *chronic myelomonocytic leukemia/th [Therapy]; *oncogene N ras; calibration; *stem cell transplantation; measurement accuracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using ad hoc statistical analysis, we designed a multicenter retrospective study to determine outcomes in 261 patients age <=70 years at diagnosis who underwent allo-HCT (n = 119) compared with those who did not (n = 142) according to the current CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS). Categorizing patients as lower risk (CPSS low/intermediate-1) or higher risk (intermediate-2/high) showed significantly improved outcomes after transplantation in higher-risk patients, with a 37% reduced hazard for death. However, although higher CPSS was associated with worse outcomes in the nontransplantation group, the score was of limited utility for post-transplantation risk stratification. This study may provide further support for the potentially beneficial role of allo-HCT in terms of long-term survival in higher-risk patients but also underscores the need for transplantation-specific risk assessment. Recognizing limitations of retrospective comparisons, larger and prospective comparisons are needed to further refine the indication for allo-HCT and thus counseling of patients with CMML.

The aim of this retrospective population-based cohort study is the evaluation of both clinical and economic profile of bortezomib-based versus conventional chemotherapy in daily clinical practice. Method(s): Healthcare utilization databases of six Italian regions were used to identify adult patients with non-transplant MM, who started a first-line therapy with bortezomib-based or conventional chemotherapy. Patients were matched by propensity score and were followed from treatment start until death, lost to follow-up or study end-point. Overall survival (OS) and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Association between first-line treatment and risk of death was estimated by a conditional Cox proportional regression model. Average mean cumulative costs were estimated and compared between groups. Result(s): In the period 2010-2016, 3509 non-transplant MM patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 1157 treated with bortezomib-based therapy were matched to 1826 treated with conventional chemotherapy. Median OS and RMST were 33.9 and 27.9 months, and 42.9 and 38.4 months, respectively, in the two treatment arms. Overall, these values corresponded to a HR of death of 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.89) over a time horizon of 84 months. Average cumulative cost were 83,839  and 54,499 , respectively, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 54,333  per year of life gained, a cost coherent with the willingness-to-pay thresholds frequently adopted from Western countries. Conclusion(s): These data suggested that, in a large cohort of non-transplant MM patients treated outside the experimental setting, first-line treatment with bortezomib-based therapy was associated with a favourable effectiveness and cost-effectiveness profile.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:35","2022-09-06 19:01:35","","","","(Franchi) Laboratory of Healthcare Research Pharmacoepidemiology, Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, University of Milano-Bicocca, Building U7, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, Milan 20126, Italy","12","","Ther.

Uptake of LDL has been proposed to contribute to chemotherapy resistance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines in vitro. In the present study, we analysed LDLR expression and survival using bone marrow biopsies from 187 intensively treated patients with AML. Here, increasing LDLR expression was associated with decreasing overall (58.4%, 44.2%, and 24.4%; P = 0.0018), as well as event-free survival (41.7%, 18.1%, and 14.3%; P = 0.0077), and an increasing cumulative incidence of relapse (33.9%, 55.1%, and 71.4%; P = 0.0011). Associations of LDLR expression with survival were confirmed in 557 intensively treated patients from two international validation cohorts. In the analytic and validation cohorts, LDLR expression remained associated with outcome in multivariable regression analyses including the European LeukemiaNet genetic risk classification. Thus, LDLR predicts outcome of patients with AML beyond existing risk factors. Furthermore, we found low expression levels of LDLR in most healthy tissues, suggesting it as a promising target for antibody-based pharmacodelivery approaches in AML.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

A retrospective chart review was performed from January 2009 to February 2020. Patients' demographic, pathologic and cytogenetic features, treatment characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. We identified 871 MM patients including 40 patients who developed SPM. Among the 40 patients with SPM, 17 patients developed hematological SPM and 23 patients developed solid SPM. The median time from diagnosis of MM to the occurrence of hematological SPM was 6.85 versus 3.91 years in solid SPM, with a median overall survival (OS) after diagnosis of SPM of 120 and 880 days, respectively. Interestingly, we observed that there was no significant difference in OS between MM patients with or without SPM. Multivariable analysis showed that age and autologous stem cell transplantation were independent factors associated with patients' clinical outcomes. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the etiology, biology, clinical outcome and management in MM patients with SPM.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:35","2022-09-06 19:01:35","","674-679","","5","39","","Hematol.

The oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib is suitable for continuous dosing, with predictable, manageable toxicities. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM2 trial, transplant-ineligible NDMM patients were randomized to ixazomib 4 mg (n = 351) or placebo (n = 354) plus Rd. After 18 cycles, dexamethasone was discontinued and treatment was continued using reduced-dose ixazomib (3 mg) and lenalidomide (10 mg) until progression/toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 35.3 vs 21.8 months with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.830; 95% confidence interval, 0.676-1.018; P = .073; median follow-up, 53.3 and 55.8 months). Complete (26% vs 14%; odds ratio [OR], 2.10; P < .001) and >= very good partial response (63% vs 48%; OR, 1.87; P < .001) rates were higher with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd. In a prespecified high-risk cytogenetics subgroup, median PFS was 23.8 vs 18.0 months (HR, 0.690; P = .019). Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly grade 1/2. With ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, 88% vs 81% of patients experienced grade >=3 TEAEs, 66% vs 62% serious TEAEs, and 35% vs 27% TEAEs resulting in regimen discontinuation; 8% vs 6% died on study. Addition of ixazomib to Rd was tolerable with no new safety signals and led to a clinically meaningful PFS benefit of 13.5 months. Ixazomib-Rd is a feasible option for certain patients who can benefit from an all-oral triplet combination.

This registry-based study was aimed to analyze outcome of patients with t(4;11) BCP-ALL treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) between 2000 and 2017, focusing on the impact of measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of transplant. Among 151 patients (median age, 38) allotransplanted from either HLA-matched siblings or unrelated donors, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 51% and 60%, whereas relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 30% and 20%, respectively. These results were comparable to a cohort of contemporary patients with diploid normal karyotype (NK) BCP-ALL with equivalent inclusion criteria (n = 567). Among patients with evaluable MRD pre-alloHSCT, a negative status was the strongest beneficial factor influencing LFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.2, p < 0.001), OS (HR = 0.14, p < 0.001), RI (HR = 0.23, p = 0.001), and NRM (HR = 0.16, p = 0.002), with a similar outcome to MRD-negative NK BCP-ALL patients. In contrast, among patients with detectable pretransplant MRD, outcome in t(4;11) BCP-ALL was inferior to NK BCP-ALL (LFS: 27% vs. 50%, p = 0.02). These results support indication of alloHSCT in CR1 for t(4;11) BCP-ALL patients, provided a negative MRD status is achieved. Conversely, pre-alloHSCT additional therapy is warranted in MRD-positive patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:35","2022-09-06 19:01:35","","2232-2242","","8","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\FGB5BAEI\Esteve J. et al. - 2021 - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2010373685","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cyclosporine/cb [Drug Combination]; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; human; major clinical study; male; mycophenolate mofetil/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; overall survival; retrospective study; human cell; mortality; cancer prognosis; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; incidence; age; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer specific survival; methotrexate/cb [Drug Combination]; mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *leukemia remission; cancer patient; HLA matching; *gene; clinical outcome; unrelated donor; karyotype; *minimal residual disease/di [Diagnosis]; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; relapse; treatment indication; *pre B lymphocyte; cancer registry; *minimal residual disease/th [Therapy]; immunosuppressive agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; graft rejection/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Aff1 gene; *B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; *B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; *chromosome translocation 11/di [Diagnosis]; *chromosome translocation 4/di [Diagnosis]; *kmt2a gene; *measurable residual disease/di [Diagnosis]; *measurable residual disease/th [Therapy]; immunosuppressive agent/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; sibling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forty-two percent of patients had a high or very high revised Disease Risk Index (rDRI), 55% had an European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score (EBMT-RS) >=4, and 36% had an age-adjusted Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI-age) score >=3. Each of these was considered an unfavorable score. Using the pretransplantation unfavorable scores that had an independent impact on each transplantation outcome studied in multivariate analysis allowed for better stratification of patient outcomes. Thus, the 3-year overall survival (OS) in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 unfavorable scores was 86%, 56%, 36%, and 24%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was negatively impacted by the EBMT-RS and the HCT-CI-age score (3-year NRM in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores was 12%, 33%, and 43%, respectively), whereas the EBMT-RS and the rDRI had an impact on the 3-year relapse incidence (8%, 18%, and 41% in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores, respectively).

However, some patients relapse and, given its prevalence, patients with high hyperdiploidy account for a large proportion of all relapses. We aimed to evaluate putative risk factors and determine the optimal pattern of trisomies for predicting outcome. Method(s): We used discovery and validation cohorts from consecutive trials-UKALL97/99 (n=456) and UKALL2003 (n=725)-to develop the prognostic profile. UKALL97/99 recruited patients aged 1-18 years between Jan 1, 1997, and June 15, 2002, and UKALL2003 recruited children and young adults aged 1-24 years between Oct 1, 2003, and June 30, 2001, from the UK and Ireland who were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation testing was performed on pre-treatment bone marrow samples by regional UK National Health Service genetic laboratories or centrally by the Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, and results were reported using established nomenclature and definitions. We examined the prognostic effect of previously proposed genetic and non-genetic risk factors among patients with high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on UKALL2003. We used Bayesian information criterion, targeted projection pursuit, and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal number of trisomies, and best subset regression and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal combination. Survival analysis considered three endpoints, as follows: event-free survival, defined as time to relapse, second tumour, or death, censored at last contact; relapse rate, defined as time to relapse for those reaching complete remission, censored at death in remission or last contact; and overall survival, defined as time to death, censored at last contact. Finding(s): The median follow-up time for UKALL97/99 was 10.59 years (IQR 9.25-12.06) and 9.40 years (8.00-11.55) for UKALL2003. UKALL97/99 included 208 female patients and 248 male patients, and UKALL2003 included 345 female patients and 380 male patients. We deduced that the trisomic status of four chromosomes provided the optimal information for predicting outcome. The good risk profile comprised karyotypes with +17 and +18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20. All remaining cases were classified in the poor risk profile. The ratio of patients with good risk and poor risk was 82:18 and 80:20 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, patients with the high hyperdiploid good risk profile had an improved response to treatment compared with other patients with high hyperdiploidy at 10 years (relapse rate 5% [95% CI 3-7] vs 16% [10-23]; p<0.0001; event-free survival 92% [90-94] vs 81% [73-86]; p<0.0001; and overall survival 96% [94-97] vs 86% [79-91]; p<0.0001). The outcome for high hyperdiploid poor risk patients was similar to that of patients with an intermediate cytogenetic profile. The prognostic effect of the UKALL high hyperdiploid profile was independent of minimal residual disease and the profile outperformed other high hyperdiploid risk profiles. Interpretation(s): Future clinical trials and treatment protocols using high hyperdiploidy as a risk stratification factor should consider modifying the definition beyond chromosome count to incorporate this novel UKALL high hyperdiploid profile.

Because antibiotics induce dysbiosis, we examined the association of broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent aGVHD risk in pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia. We performed a retrospective analysis in a dataset merged from 2 sources: (1) the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, an observational transplantation registry, and (2) the Pediatric Health Information Services, an administrative database from freestanding children's hospitals. We captured exposure to 3 classes of antibiotics used for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia: (1) broad-spectrum cephalosporins, (2) antipseudomonal penicillins, and (3) carbapenems. The primary outcome was grade II-IV aGVHD; secondary outcomes were grade III-IV aGVHD and lower GI GVHD. The adjusted logistic regression model (full cohort) and time-to-event analysis (subcohort) included transplantation characteristics, GVHD risk factors, and adjunctive antibiotic exposures as covariates. The full cohort included 2550 patients at 36 centers; the subcohort included 1174 patients. In adjusted models, carbapenems were associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD in the full cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.51) and subcohort (sub hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.72), as well as with an increased risk of grade III-IV aGVHD (subHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.52). Early carbapenem exposure (before day 0) especially impacted aGVHD risk. For antipseudomonal penicillins, the associations with aGVHD were in the direction of increased risk but were not statistically significant. There was no identified association between broad-spectrum cephalosporins and aGVHD. Carbapenems, more than other broad-spectrum antibiotics, should be used judiciously in pediatric HCT recipients to minimize aGVHD risk. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying this association.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:35","2022-09-06 19:01:35","","177.e1-177.e8","","2","27","","Transplant.

Randomized controlled trials support the use of antifungal prophylaxis with antimold activity as an optimal strategy for risk reduction in this population, but studies outlining the practical application of evidence-based recommendations are lacking. Procedure: We conducted a 15-year, single-institution retrospective review in a diverse cohort of children with hematologic malignancies treated with chemotherapy to determine the incidence of proven or probable IMI diagnosed between 2006 and 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify host and disease factors associated with IMI risk. We then compared the incidence and type of IMI and related factors before and after 2016 implementation of an evidence-based, risk-adapted antifungal prophylaxis algorithm that broadened coverage to include molds in patients at highest risk for IMI. Result(s): We identified 61 cases of proven or probable IMI in 1456 patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies during the study period (4.2%). Implementation of an antifungal prophylaxis algorithm reduced the IMI incidence in this population from 4.8% to 2.9%.

Procedure: This retrospective analysis examined VOD/SOS risk and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received myeloablative alloHCT in 2008-2011 with (n = 148) and without (n = 348; controls) prior GO exposure and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Result(s): Cumulative incidences (95% confidence interval [CI]) of VOD/SOS and severe VOD/SOS, respectively, at 100 days were 16% (11-23%) and 8% (4-13%) for GO-exposed patients and 10% (7-13%) and 3% (2-5%) for controls. With a median follow-up of approximately 7 years, the 5-year adjusted overall survival probability (95% CI) after alloHCT was 51% (43-58%) and 55% (50-60%) for GO-exposed patients and controls, respectively; three (4%) and one (<1%) deaths were attributed to VOD/SOS. In multivariate analyses, GO exposure was observed to be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS at 100 days, but was not associated with overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, or nonrelapse mortality. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that GO treatment prior to alloHCT in pediatric patients may increase the risk of VOD/SOS but not death.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","e29067","","8","68","","Pediatr.

We aimed to examine prolonged length of in-hospital stay (LOS) due to Covid-19 among patients with lymphoma and assess its determinants and outcomes. Adult patients with lymphoma admitted for Covid-19 to 16 French hospitals in March and April, 2020 were included. Length of in-hospital stay was analyzed as a competitor vs death. The study included 111 patients. The median age was 65 years (range, 19-92). Ninety-four patients (85%) had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti-CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1-235). After a median follow-up of 191 days (3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42-3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.52, p = 0.039). An age >= 70 years and relapsed/refractory lymphoma were also associated with prolonged LOS and decreased overall survival. In conclusion, an age >= 70 years, a relapsed/refractory lymphoma and recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy are risk factors for prolonged LOS and death for lymphoma patients hospitalized for Covid-19. These findings may contribute to guide the management of lymphoma during the pandemic, support evaluating specific therapeutic approaches, and raise questions on the efficacy and timing of vaccination of this particular population.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","934-944","","8","96","","Am.

We retrospectively analyzed 319 patients with newly diagnosed AML (127 with IDH1, 135 with IDH2R140, and 57 with IDH2R172 mutations) treated with IC in 3 Acute Leukemia French Association prospective trials. In each IDH subgroup, we analyzed the prognostic impact of clinical and genetic covariates, and the role of HSCT. In patients with IDH1 mutations, the presence of NPM1 mutations was the only variable predicting improved overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (P < .0001). In IDH2R140-mutated AML, normal karyotype (P = .008) and NPM1 mutations (P = .01) predicted better OS. NPM1 mutations were associated with better disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0009), whereas the presence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with shorter DFS (P = .0006). In IDH2R172-mutated AML, platelet count was the only variable retained in the multivariate model for OS (P = .002). Among nonfavorable European LeukemiaNet 2010-eligible patients, 71 (36%) underwent HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) and had longer OS (P = .03) and DFS (P = .02) than nontransplanted patients. Future clinical trials testing frontline IDH inhibitors combined with IC may consider stratification on NPM1 mutational status, the primary prognostic factor in IDH1- or IDH2R140-mutated AML. HSCT improve OS of nonfavorable IDH1/2-mutated AML and should be fully integrated into the treatment strategy.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","2827-2837","","20","137","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\KL8FQ4K8\Duchmann M. et al. - 2021 - Prognostic significance of concurrent gene mutatio.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2012090978","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; outcome assessment; prospective study; cancer survival; unclassified drug; randomized controlled trial (topic); disease association; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; karyotype; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; anthracycline/dt [Drug Therapy]; cytogenetics; drug megadose; *cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; *cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; multiple cycle treatment; *gene mutation; clinical assessment; DNA methyltransferase 3A/ec [Endogenous Compound]; nucleophosmin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; disease free survival; *cancer prognosis; remission; clinical evaluation; transcription factor RUNX1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; platelet count; *daunorubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; *daunorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *acute myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; trisomy 8; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; K ras protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Flt3 ligand/ec [Endogenous Compound]; ASXL1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; transcription factor EZH2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; transcription factor ETV6/ec [Endogenous Compound]; genetic analysis; clinical trial (topic); WT1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *clofarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; *clofarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; *isocitrate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; bcor protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; BCORL1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CALR protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Cbl protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CEBPA protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; CSF3R protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; endogenous compound/ec [Endogenous Compound]; isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD)/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Janus kinase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; KIT protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; MPL protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Nipbl protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; nras protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; PHF6 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; Rad21 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; RIT1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; setbp1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; sf3b1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; SMC1A protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; smc3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; srsf3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; stag2 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; tet3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; transcription factor GATA 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; u2af1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; ZRSR2 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some patients have poor response to treatment, and the prognostic significance of KIT mutation is still controversial. This study aimed to explore the prognostic significance of different KIT mutation subtypes and minimal residual disease (MRD) in CBF-AML. We retrospectively evaluated continuous patients diagnosed with CBF-AML in our center between January 2014 and April 2019. Of the 215 patients, 147 (68.4%) and 68 (31.6%) patients were RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and CBFB-MYH11 positive, respectively. KIT mutations were found in 71 (33.0%) patients; of them, 38 (53.5%) had D816/D820 mutations. After excluding 10 patients who died or were lost to follow-up within a half year, 42.0% (n = 86) of the remaining 205 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). An MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation predicted relapse (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that D816 or D820 mutations and MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation were independent adverse factors affecting relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Allo-HSCT could improve RFS (74.4% vs. 34.6%, P < 0.001) and OS (78.1% vs. 52.3%, P = 0.002). In conclusion, high-risk CBF-AML patients must be identified before treatment. D816/D820 mutation, MRD > 0.1% at the end of two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy predicted poor survivals, and allo-HSCT can improve the survival of properly identified patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","1203-1212","","5","100","","Ann.

Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) is thus an attractive procedure for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. This study was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of haploHCT in South Africa. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who received unmanipulated haploHCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide at 2 high-volume HCT centers between 2014 and 2019. We assessed overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), and incidence of acute GVHD. The median recipient age was 44 years (range, 15 to 73 years) and the median donor age was 36 years (range, 9 to 68 years). Acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the most common indications for haploHCT (61.2%). The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score was >=5 in 44 patients (32.8%). Seventy-seven patients (57.4%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The majority of patients received a sex-matched transplant (57.4%) and had peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) as the stem cell source (70.9%). Sixteen patients (11.9%) had an incongruent cytomegalovirus serostatus at transplantation. The median duration of follow-up was 10.8 months (range, 0.36 to 70.8 months). OS was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47% to 64%) at 1 year and 37% (95% CI, 28% to 47%) at 3 years. DFS was 47% (95% CI, 38% to 55%) at 1 year and 32% (95% CI, 24% to 41%) at 3 years. The 100-day and 3-year cumulative incidence of NRM was 18% (95% CI, 11% to 25%) and 41% (95% CI, 32% to 50%), respectively, and the 1- and 3-year cumulative RI was 16% (95% CI, 11% to 24%) and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%), respectively. The 1-year OS was 55% (95% CI, 40% to 67%) for the patients with AML/MDS versus 41% (95% CI, 21% to 60%) for those with ALL. Forty-five patients (41.7%) developed acute GVHD by day +100; of these, 80% had grade I-II disease. Fifty patients (37.5%) developed cytomegalovirus infection that required therapy. On multivariable analysis, older donor age was an independent risk factor for lower DFS. RI was higher for diagnoses other than acute leukemia/MDS (relative risk [RR], 2.62; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.15; P = .027), decreased for PBSC versus bone marrow (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.95; P = .038) and decreased for offspring donors (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.67; P = .006). These data support the feasibility of haploHCT and suggest that unmanipulated haploHCT using a younger parent or offspring donor is a viable option for adults in sub-Saharan Africa with acute leukemia and MDS who lack a suitable related or unrelated donor.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","1002.e1-1002.e8","","12","27","","Transplant.

Hypoalbuminemia is a negative predictor of morbidity and mortality in several malignancies. We evaluated the relationship between baseline serum albumin levels on treatment-related complications, as well as short-term mortality and overall survival (OS) in 756 newly diagnosed AML patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to examine treatment-related complications and OS according to pretreatment serum albumin levels: normal albumin >=3.5 g/dl, marked hypoalbuminemia <2.5 g/dl, and hypoalbuminemia 2.5-3.4 g/dl. In an adjusted multivariate analysis, a lower baseline albumin was independently associated with a higher number of grade >=3 complications when adjusting for age, secondary AML, sex and intensive treatment. When comparing normal to markedly low albumin levels, the estimated mean number of complications increases by a factor of 1.35. Patients who had a normal baseline albumin had a 30 day-mortality rate of 4.8%, which was significantly lower compared with patients with hypoalbuminemia (16.5%) and marked hypoalbuminemia (33.9%; p < 0.01). Similarly, 60-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the hypoalbuminemia group (24.0%) and marked hypoalbuminemia group (45%) compared with normal albumin group (8.3%; p < 0.01). Patients with lower baseline albumin levels have increased treatment-related morbidity and mortality, suggesting that pre-treatment serum albumin is an important independent prognostic marker.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","697-706","","5","39","","Hematol.

Data from children (0-8 years for girls and 0-10 years for boys), adolescents (9-19 years for girls and 11-19 years for boys), and adults (age >= 20 years) with newly diagnosed CML-CP receiving imatinib as first-line therapy between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 135 children (cohort 1), 189 adolescents (cohort 2), and 658 adults (cohort 3: age 20-39 years, n = 305; cohort 4: age 40-59 years, n = 270; and cohort 5: age 60-83 years, n = 83) were included in this study. When compared with children, adolescents showed a significantly higher white blood cell count (P = 0.033) and basophil percentage in peripheral blood (P = 0.002) and a significantly higher prevalence of splenomegaly (P = 0.004). Both children and adolescents presented with more aggressive clinical features than adults. During median follow-ups of 28 months (range, 3-161 months) in children, 33 months (range, 3-152 months) in adolescents, and 48 months (range, 3-157 months) in adults, multivariate analysis showed that children and adolescents had higher probabilities of achieving complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, and molecular response4.5.

Age was not associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. Although they exhibited more aggressive clinical features at diagnosis, both children and adolescents achieved superior treatment responses than adults.

However, because of the high risk of severe complications of this therapy, up to 50% of patients may require being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to manage life-threatening conditions. We aimed to evaluate the in-hospital mortality of allo-HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU and to identify those variables associated with in-hospital mortality. A 10-year (January 2010 to December 2019), single-center, retrospective study was conducted in Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona. We included all consecutive allo-HSCT patients who required admission to the ICU. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were registered. Severity scores and the need for organ support were also assessed on days 1, 3, and 5 of ICU admission. In-hospital mortality-associated independent variables were identified using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Three hundred twenty-three patients underwent allo-HSCT during the study period, of whom 82 (25%) were admitted to the ICU; 53 (65%) male, with a median age of 51 (38-59) years. Most patients received allo-HSCT for the treatment of lymphoma (20 patients [24%]) or acute leukemia (44 patients [54%]). The median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 23 (17-28), and the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission was 9 (7-11). Forty-nine (60%) patients died in the ICU, and 11 (13%) died in the hospital after being discharged from the ICU. Disease-related characteristics were not associated with mortality. Yet, SOFA score on day 1 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.04-1.02]; P =.002), the need for vasopressors on day 3 (HR: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.27-4.36]; P =.007), and a nondecreasing SOFA score on day 5 (HR: 2.13 [95% CI: 1.03-4.39]; P =.04), were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Mortality in allo-HSCT patients who require ICU admission remains high. In the present study, SOFA score, the need for vasopressors on day 3, and a nondecreasing SOFA score on day 5 predicted in-hospital mortality.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:36","2022-09-06 19:01:36","","865.e1-865.e7","","10","27","","Transplant.

Clearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow results in superior outcomes, although its attainment or sustainment does not alter clinical decision-making. Studies that have evaluated MRD serially are limited in length. We therefore aimed to evaluate longitudinal changes in MRD-status (dynamics) and their association with progression-free survival in patients with multiple myeloma. Method(s): In this single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA) who had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following unrestricted frontline therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2 or lower, including patients who started maintenance before study enrolment. All participants received lenalidomide maintenance at 10 mg for 21 days of 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxic effects for up to 5 years on protocol. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 60 months per protocol and key secondary endpoints were MRD rates after completion of the 12th, 24th, and 36th cycle of maintenance and the association between progression-free survival and annual measurement of MRD status. MRD was assessed from first-pull bone marrow aspirates at baseline and annually by flow cytometry per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, (limit of detection of at least 1 x 10-5) up to a maximum of 5 years. Patients who completed at least four cycles of treatment were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint, and patients who had completed at least one dose of treatment on protocol were assessable for secondary endpoints. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02538198, and is now closed to accrual. Finding(s): Between Sept 8, 2015, and Jan 25, 2019, 108 patients (100 evaluable for the primary endpoint) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 40.7 months (95% CI 38.7-45.0). At 60 months, progression-free survival was 64% (95% CI 52-79). Median progression-free survival was unreached (95% CI unreached-unreached). MRD dynamics were assessed using 340 MRD assessments done over 5 years for 103 evaluable patients. Patients who sustained MRD negativity for 2 years (n=34) had no recorded disease progression at median 19.8 months (95% CI 15.8-22.3) past the 2-year maintenance landmark. By contrast, patients who lost their MRD-negative responses (n=10) were more likely to progress than those with sustained MRD negativity (HR infinite; p<0.0001) and those with persistent MRD positivity (HR 5.88, 95% CI 1.18-33.33; p=0.015) at the 2-year landmark. Haematological and non-haematological serious adverse events occurred in 19 patients (18%). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were decreased lymphocyte count in 48 (44%) patients and decreased neutrophil count in 47 (44%) patients. One death occurred on study due to sepsis and heart failure and was considered unrelated to the study drug. Interpretation(s): Serial measurements of MRD allow for dynamic assessment of risk for disease progression. Early intervention should be investigated for patients with loss of MRD negativity. Sustained MRD positivity is not categorically an unfavourable outcome and might portend prolonged stability of low-level disease.

Although several modifications have since been made and delays and dose reductions are common especially during the first treatment cycles, there are minimal data on the prognostic effect of these modifications. In this study, based on data from 897 patients with MDS treated with 5-azacytidine recorded in a national registry, the effect of treatment delays and dose reductions on response, transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia, and survival (after 5-azacytidine initiation, OST) were analysed. Delays during the first two cycles were noted in 150 patients (16.7%) and were found to adversely affect OST independently of the International Prognostic Scoring System score [hazard ratio (HR), 1.368; P = 0.033] or pre-existing neutropenia (HR, 1.42; P = 0.015). In patients achieving a response, delays before response achievement were correlated with its type (complete remission, 2.8 days/cycle; partial remission, 3.3 days/cycle; haematologic improvement, 5.6 days/cycle; P = 0.041), while delays after response achievement did not have any effect on retention of response or survival. Dose reductions were found to have no prognostic impact. Based on our results, treatment delays especially during the first cycles should be avoided, even in neutropenic patients. This strict strategy may be loosened after achieving a favourable response.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:37","2022-09-06 19:01:37","","978-987","","6","192","","Br.

We studied the outcomes of total body irradiation (TBI)-based versus chemotherapy (CT)-based MAC regimens in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study included 427 patients who underwent first haplo-HCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), following TBI-based (n = 188; 44%) or CT-based (n = 239; 56%) MAC. The median patient age was 32 years. Fludarabine-TBI (72%) and thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (65%) were the most frequently used TBI- and CT-based regimens, respectively. In the TBI and CT cohorts, 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 45% versus 37% (P = .05), overall survival (OS) was 51% versus 47% (P = .18), relapse incidence (RI) was 34% versus 32% (P = .44), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 21% versus 31% (P < .01).

The type of conditioning regimen did not impact RI, chronic GVHD, OS, or GVHD-free, relapse-free survival after adjusting for transplantation-related variables. TBI-based MAC was associated with lower NRM and better LFS compared with CT-based MAC in patients with ALL after haplo-HCT/PTCy.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:37","2022-09-06 19:01:37","","171.e1-171.e8","","2","27","","Transplant.

Here, we compared the allo-HCT outcomes of CBT versus single-allele-mismatched MMUD allo-HCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in acute myeloid leukemia. Method(s): Patients who underwent a first CBT without PTCy (N = 902) or allo-HCT from a (HLA 9/10) MMUD with PTCy (N = 280) were included in the study. A multivariate regression analysis was performed for the whole population. A matched-pair analysis was carried out by propensity score-based 1:1 matching of patients (177 pairs) with known cytogenetic risk. Result(s): The incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 6 months was 36% versus 32% (p = 0.07) and 15% versus 11% (p = 0.16) for CBT and MMUD cohorts, respectively. CBT was associated with a higher incidence of graft failure (11% vs. 4%, p < 0.01) and higher 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) (30% vs. 16%, p < 0.01) compared to MMUD. In the multivariate analysis, CBT was associated with a higher risk of, NRM (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.46-2.99, p < 0.0001), and relapse (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1-1.83, p = 0.05), which resulted in worse leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.12, p < 0.0001), overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.33-2.17, p < 0.0001), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.21-1.83, p < 0.0001) compared to MMUD. The risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (p = 0.052) and chronic GVHD (p = 0.69) did not differ significantly between the cohorts. These results were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. Conclusion(s): CBT was associated with lower LFS, OS, and GRFS due to higher NRM, compared to MMUD allo-HCT with PTCy. In the absence of a fully matched donor, 9/10 MMUD with PTCy may be preferred over CBT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:37","2022-09-06 19:01:37","","76","","1","14","","J.

Only 64% of total patients received multi-agent therapy; 32% received either single-agent therapy or no therapy at all. One-month mortality was 6% for patients <=18 years, 6% for 19-40 years, 10% for 41-60 years, and 21% for >60 years. OS at 1- and 3-year were 81% and 75%, respectively.

Because they are perceived to be unfit for, unwilling to receive, or unlikely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy they represent an important unmet need. Tosedostat is a selective oral aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in phase I/II trials showed acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy. We report the only randomised study of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAC) combined with tosedostat (LDAC-T) versus LDAC in untreated older patients not suitable for intensive treatment. A total of 243 patients were randomised 1:1 as part of the 'Pick-a-Winner' LI-1 trial. There was a statistically non-significant increase in the complete remission (CR) rate with the addition of tosedostat, LDAC-T 19% versus LDAC 12% [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-1.23; P = 0.17]. For overall response (CR+CR with incomplete recovery of counts), there was little evidence of a benefit to the addition of tosedostat (25% vs. 18%; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37-1.27; P = 0.22). However, overall survival (OS) showed no difference (2-year OS 16% vs. 12%, hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.28; P = 0.8). Exploratory analyses failed to identify any subgroup benefitting from tosedostat. Despite promising pre-clinical, early non-randomised clinical data with acceptable toxicity and an improvement in response, we did not find evidence that the addition of tosedostat to LDAC produced a survival benefit in this group of patients with AML.

Standard nonintensive therapies have low response rates and only extend life by a few months. Quizartinib is an oral Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor with reported activity in wild-type patients. As part of the AML LI trial, we undertook a randomized evaluation of low-dose ara-C (LDAC) with or without quizartinib in patients not fit for intensive chemotherapy. Overall, survival was not improved (202 patients), but in the 27 FLT3-ITD patients, the addition of quizartinib to LDAC improved response (P = .05) with complete remission/complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery for quizartinib 1 LDAC in 5/13 (38%) vs 0/14 (0%) in patients receiving LDAC alone. Overall survival (OS) in these FLT3-ITD1 patients was also significantly improved at 2 years for quizartinib 1 LDAC (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% confidence intervals: 0.16, 0.85, P = .04). Median OS was 13.7 months compared with 4.2 months with LDAC alone.

We aimed to establish the baseline characteristics and outcomes of paediatric patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the pre-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor era. Method(s): This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included paediatric patients (aged 1-18 years) with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion (ABL1 fusion-positive, ABL2 fusion-positive, CSF1R fusion-positive, and PDGFRB fusion-positive) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia enrolled in clinical trials of multidrug chemotherapy done between Oct 3, 2000, and Aug 28, 2018, in which tyrosine-kinase inhibitors had not been given as a first-line treatment. Patients from 14 European, North American, and Asia-Pacific study groups of the Ponte di Legno group were included. No patients were excluded, and patients were followed up by individual study groups. Through the Ponte di Legno group, we collected data on the baseline characteristics of patients, including IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A/B deletion status, and whether haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had been done, as well as treatment outcomes, including complete remission, no response, relapse, early death, and treatment-related mortality, response to prednisone, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at end of induction therapy. 5-year event-free survival and 5-year overall survival were estimated by use of Kaplan-Meier methods, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was calculated by use of a competing risk model. Finding(s): We identified 122 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (77 from European study groups, 25 from North American study groups, and 20 from Asia-Pacific study groups). 64 (52%) of 122 patients were PDGFRB fusion-positive, 40 (33%) were ABL1 fusion-positive, ten (8%) were CSF1R fusion-positive, and eight (7%) were ABL2 fusion-positive. In all 122 patients, 5-year event-free survival was 59.1% (95% CI 50.5-69.1), 5-year overall survival was 76.1% (68.6-84.5), and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31.0% (95% CI 22.4-40.1). MRD at the end of induction therapy was high (>=10-2 cells) in 61 (66%) of 93 patients, and most prevalent in patients with ABL2 fusions (six [86%] of 7 patients) and PDGFRB fusion-positive B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (43 [88%] of 49 patients). MRD at the end of induction therapy of 10-2 cells or more was predictive of an unfavourable outcome (hazard ratio of event-free survival in patients with a MRD of >=10-2 vs those with a MRD of <10-2 3.33 [95% CI 1.46-7.56], p=0.0039). Of the 36 (30%) of 119 patients who relapsed, 25 (69%) relapsed within 3 years of diagnosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse in 41 patients who underwent HSCT (17.8% [95% CI 7.7-31.3]) was lower than in the 43 patients who did not undergo HSCT (45.1% [28.4-60.5], p=0.013), but event-free survival and overall survival did not differ between these two groups. Interpretation(s): Children with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have poor outcomes when treated with regimens that do not contain a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, despite the use of high-risk chemotherapy regimens and frequent HSCT upon first remission. Our findings provide a reference for evaluating the potential benefit of first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment in patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

Moreover, the Treg content in stem cells harvested from PB has been suggested to be correlated with acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD) and immunologic recovery after allogeneic PB stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the graft content of Tregs, as graft CD3+/Tregs ratio (gCD3/TregsR), on acute GVHD and post-allo-PBSCT outcomes. We prospectively enrolled 94 consecutive patients at 9 Italian centers of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) with acute myelogenous (n = 71; 75%) or lymphoblastic (n = 23; 25%) leukemia in complete remission who underwent matched related donor (n = 35; 37%) or unrelated donor (n = 59; 63%) allo-PBSCT. The median graft CD3+ cell, Treg, and gCD3/TregsR values were 196 x 106/kg body weight (range, 17 to 666 x 106/kg), 3 x 106/kg (range, 0.1 to 35 x 106/kg), and 71 (range, 1 to 1883), respectively. The discriminatory power of the gCD3/TregsR value to predict grade >=II aGVHD was assessed by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Any grade and grade >=II aGVHD occurred in 24 (26%) and 17 (18%) allo-PBSCT recipients, respectively. By ROC analysis, AUC (0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.608 to 0.866; P =.002) identified 70 as the optimal gCD3/TregsR cutoff value predicting the appearance of grade >=II aGVHD with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Patients were subdivided into a high (ROC curve value >=70) gCD3/TregsR group (HR; n = 48) and a low (ROC curve value <70) gCD3/TregsR group (LR; n = 46). The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in the LR group compared with the HR group (9% [4 of 46] versus 27% [13 of 48]) in both univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.44 to 16.17; P =.015) and multivariate analysis (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.34 to 18.93; P =.017), whereas no differences were documented taking into account aGVHD of any grade. The overall survival, disease-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse rates at 2 and 3 years were 61% and 54%, 62% and 55%, 15% and 23%, and 27% and 30%, respectively. Of note, gCD3/TregsR did not significantly correlate with relapse (P =.135). Taken together, our data from this prospective multicenter study confirm the value of Tregs in preventing aGVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia effect. © 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Disease heterogeneity is well documented, and patient stratification determines treatment decisions. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from risk-stratified AML are crucial for studying AML biology and testing novel therapeutics. Despite recent advances in PDX modeling of AML, reproducible engraftment of human AML is primarily limited to high-risk (HR) cases, with inconsistent or very protracted engraftment observed for favorable-risk (FR) and intermediate-risk (IR) patients. We used NSGS mice to characterize the engraftment robustness/kinetics of 28 AML patient samples grouped according to molecular/ cytogenetic classification and assessed whether the orthotopic coadministration of patientmatched bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) improves AML engraftment. PDX event-free survival correlated well with the predictable prognosis of risk-stratified AML patients. The majority (85-94%) of the mice were engrafted in bone marrow (BM) independently of the risk group, although HR AML patients showed engraftment levels that were significantly superior to those of FR or IR AML patients. Importantly, the engraftment levels observed in NSGS mice by week 6 remained stable over time. Serial transplantation and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays revealed long-term engraftment limited to HR AML patients, fitter leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in HR AML samples, and the presence of AML LICs in the CD342 leukemic fraction, regardless of the risk group. Finally, orthotopic coadministration of patient-matched BM MSCs and AML cells was dispensable for BM engraftment levels but favored peripheralization of engrafted AML cells. This comprehensive characterization of human AML engraftment in NSGS mice offers a valuable platform for in vivo testing of targeted therapies in risk-stratified AML patient samples.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:37","2022-09-06 19:01:37","","4842-4854","","23","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\PDQGJZK5\De La Guardia R.D. et al. - 2021 - Engraftment characterization of risk-stratified AM.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2015934571","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; male; human cell; nonhuman; follow up; event free survival; cytogenetics; fluorescence in situ hybridization; *acute myeloid leukemia; prognosis; clinical article; animal experiment; animal model; mouse; *tumor engraftment; cell isolation; confocal microscopy; mesenchymal stroma cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven hundred forty-one patients (820 patient LOTs) with an Rd backbone (VRd, n = 349; KRd, n = 218; DRd, n = 99; IRd, n = 154) and 348 patients (392 patient LOTs) with a Pd backbone (VPd, n = 52; KPd, n = 146; DPd, n = 149; IPd, n = 45) in LOTs >=2 were identified.

Thirty two percent (n=199) received TBI regimens whereas 68% (n=425) received non-TBI regimens. Five-year non-relapse mortality was higher with TBI regimens (22% vs. 11%, P<0.0001) but relapse was lower (23% vs. 37%, P<0.0001) compared to non-TBI regimens. Consequently, overall (62% vs. 60%, P=1.00) and leukemia-free survival (55% vs. 52%, P=0.42) did not differ between treatment groups.

Two consecutive international prospective studies, ALL-SCT-(I)BFM 2003 and 2007 were conducted in 1150 pediatric patients. 569 presented with VHR disease leading to any kind of HSCT. All patients >2 year old were transplanted after TBI-based MAC. The median follow-up was 5 years. 463 patients were transplanted from matched donor (MD) and 106 from mismatched donor (MMD). 214 were in CR1. Stem cell source was unmanipulated BM for 330 patients, unmanipulated PBSC for 135, ex vivo T-cell depleted PBSC for 62 and cord-blood for 26. There were more advanced disease, more ex vivo T-cell depletion, and more chemotherapy based conditioning regimen for patients transplanted from MMD as compared to those transplanted from MSD or MD. Median follow up (reversed Kaplan Meier estimator) was 4.99 years, median follow up of survivals was 4.88, range (0.01-11.72) years. The 4-year CI of extensive cGvHD was 13 +/- 2% and 17 +/- 4% (p = NS) for the patients transplanted from MD and MMD, respectively. 4-year EFS was statistically better for patients transplanted from MD (60 +/- 2% vs. 42 +/- 5%, p < 0.001) for the whole cohort. This difference does not exist if considering separately patients treated in the most recent study. There was no difference in 4-year CI of relapse. The 4-year NRM was lower for patients transplanted from MD (9 +/- 1% vs. 23 +/- 4%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, donor-type appears as a negative risk-factor for OS, EFS, and NRM.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) blockade improves hematopoietic recovery in mice after radiation or chemotherapy, through protection of the hematopoietic stem cells which express the LH receptor. We hypothesized that LH blockade improves hematopoietic recovery following intensive chemotherapy in patients with leukemia. We conducted a retrospective analysis on pre-menopausal women with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received intensive chemotherapy and leuprolide given for abnormal uterine bleeding prevention or treatment. Given that leuprolide is more commonly administered in younger patients, we performed propensity score matching between the leuprolide (AML n=64; ALL n=49) and control groups (AML n=128; ALL n=98 patients). Patients with AML who received leuprolide had an additional increase of 13.8x109/L/year in their platelet count, and a 0.19x 109/L/year increase in their lymphocyte count after chemotherapy compared to control (P=0.02; P=0.03 respectively). Those with ALL who received leuprolide had an additional increase of 0.37x109/L/year in their absolute neutrophil count (P=0.02). In AML, leuprolide was associated with higher long-term hemoglobin levels (P<0.001) and less blood transfusions (mean, 23.9 vs. 34.7 units; P=0.002) compared to control. In a multivariate analysis, leuprolide was identified as an independent factor predicting improved hemoglobin levels, lymphocyte and platelet counts in AML. In conclusion, leuprolide use in leukemia patients receiving intensive chemotherapy was associated with improved long-term blood count recovery and with decreased transfusion requirements in AML.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:38","2022-09-06 19:01:38","","1097-1105","","4","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\L3NQLWX2\Dalle I.A. et al. - 2021 - Impact of luteinizing hormone suppression on hemat.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011692473","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; overall survival; retrospective study; follow up; *cancer chemotherapy; event free survival; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; risk factor; lymphocyte count; platelet count; hemoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; propensity score; blood transfusion; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; erythrocyte count; *leukemia; *luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound]; hematocrit; leuprorelin/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration]; leuprorelin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]; premenopause; thrombocyte transfusion; uterus bleeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NGS revealed 598 somatic mutations in 165/178 patients (92.7%). Frequently mutated genes include DNMT3A, TET2, NPM1, RUNX1, IDH2, and FLT3. Commonly detected cytogenetic profiles include normal karyotype, trisomy 8, monosomal karyotype (MK), deletion 5, complex karyotype (CK), and monosomy 7. In univariate analyses, TP53 mutation, MK, CK, and monosomy 7 were associated with decreased overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and a higher relapse incidence (RI). We defined adverse molecular-genetic profile as harboring at least one of the molecular/genetic abnormalities of TP53 mutation, MK, CK, monosomy 7, and deletion 5.

However, limited data have been published about the impact of CLL treatment on this risk. Here we followed a Danish population-based cohort of CLL patients for risks of new malignancies. Patients in the Danish CLL registry (2008-2017) were included. Up to 50 CLL-free matched comparators were identified. First-line treatment was categorized into four groups; bendamustine, chlorambucil, fludarabine or other. Patients were followed from CLL diagnosis for individual types of malignancy. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for new malignancies and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Overall, 4286 CLL patients and 214 150 controls developed 594 and 20 565 new malignancies respectively. Risk of new malignancies was increased for CLL patients. Chemotherapy treatment was registered for 1064 (25%) patients with CLL. Chemotherapy was associated with increased HR (1.51, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8) of any new malignancy. Specifically, fludarabine was associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (HR 4.93, 95% CI: 1.2-19.8). Patients with CLL are at increased risk of other haematological and solid malignancies compared to the general population.

To investigate acquisition of CNAs and their prognostic relevance in context of first-line therapy, we profiled tumor diagnosis-relapse pairs from 178 NCRI Myeloma XI (ISRCTN49407852) trial patients using digital multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. CNA profiles acquired at relapse differed substantially between MM subtypes: hyperdiploid (HRD) tumors evolved predominantly in branching pattern vs. linear pattern in t(4;14) vs. stable pattern in t(11;14). CNA acquisition also differed between subtypes based on CCND expression, with a marked enrichment of acquired del(17p) in CCND2 over CCND1 tumors. Acquired CNAs were not influenced by high-dose melphalan or lenalidomide maintenance randomization. A branching evolution pattern was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) 2.61, P = 0.0048). As an individual lesion, acquisition of gain(1q) at relapse was associated with shorter OS, independent of other risk markers or time of relapse (HR = 2.00; P = 0.021). There is an increasing need for rational therapy sequencing in MM.

We evaluated the impact of previous lenalidomide exposure in a large cohort of patients with MM undergoing mobilization and collection at a tertiary stem cell transplantation center. We hypothesized that collection of PBSCs is feasible even with a prolonged duration of previous lenalidomide therapy. We examined patients with MM who attempted stem cell mobilization and collection, seen at our center between January 2012 and July 2015. The patients were categorized into 3 groups for analysis: (1) patients with previous receipt of >6 cycles lenalidomide, (2) patients with previous receipt of <=6 cycles of lenalidomide, and (3) patients without previous lenalidomide exposure. We compared collection yields and days of apheresis among the 3 groups using linear regression analysis. We identified 297 patients with MM who underwent mobilization of PBSCs. Of these, 35 had received >6 cycles of lenalidomide (median, 8 cycles; range, 7 to 25 cycles), 156 had received <=6 cycles of lenalidomide (median, 4 cycles; range, 1 to 6 cycles), and 106 had received no lenalidomide. Prior lenalidomide exposure did not have a statistically significant impact on the absolute number of CD34+ cells collected or on the duration of collection based on a multivariate linear regression analysis for association between receipt of >6 cycles of lenalidomide. In this retrospective analysis of MM patients undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation, we show that the duration of previous lenalidomide exposure does not impact the total number of PBSCs collected or the number of days of apheresis. These data suggest that longer courses of induction therapy with lenalidomide-containing regimens to achieve a maximum response can be safe without impairing the ability to collect PBSCs, and that limiting lenalidomide use before mobilization does not appear warranted in all cases.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:38","2022-09-06 19:01:38","","661.e1-661.e6","","8","27","","Transplant.

AML is a heterogeneous disease with numerous genetic subtypes in which these disparities have not been specifically investigated. In this study, we used the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database to examine the association of race-ethnicity with leukemia cytogenetics, clinical features, and survival outcomes within major cytogenetic subgroups of pediatric AML. Compared with White non-Hispanic patients, t(8;21) AML was more prevalent among Black (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28- 3.74) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.83). The poor prognosis KMT2A rearrangement t(6;11)(q27;q23) was more prevalent among Black patients (OR, 6.12; 95% CI, 1.81-21.59). Among those with KMT2Ar AML, Black race was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.41-3.79) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 2.54; 1.43-4.51). Hispanic patients with KMT2Ar AML also had inferior EFS (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.27-3.80) and OS (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.09-3.93). Similarly, among patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML (ie, core-binding factor [CBF] AML), Black patients had inferior outcomes (EFS HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14-3.28 and OS HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.60-6.57). This disparity was not detected among patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). In conclusion, racial-ethnic disparities in survival outcomes among young people with AML are prominent and vary across cytogenetic subclasses. Future studies should explore the socioeconomic and biologic determinants of these disparities.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology.

In the United Kingdom SPIRIT2 trial comparing imatinib 400 mg daily with dasatinib 100 mg daily, diagnostic karyotypes were available in 763 of the 814 patients recruited. Of these, 27 had ACAs in either/both the original 4 major route group (trisomy 8 or 19, iso17q or a second Ph) or the 5 additional lesions recently described (trisomy 21, 3q26.2, monosomy 7/7q2, 11q23, and complex karyotypes), and their progression rate was significantly higher (22.2%) than in patients without one of these ACAs (2.2%; P , .001). Patients with ACAs had worse progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR], 5.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59-10.50; P , .001) and freedom from progression (FFP; HR, 12.66; 95% CI, 4.95-32.37; P , .001) compared with patients without ACAs. No association was seen between the Sokal or European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival (ELTS) scores and the presence of ACAs. Univariate analysis showed that higher Sokal and ELTS scores and the presence of ACAs were associated with poorer PFS, though only ACAs and high-risk ELTS scores were associated with poorer FFP. Multivariable models identified both the Sokal/ELTS score and ACAs as significant independent factors for PFS but only ELTS score and ACAs as significant independent factors for FFP. The data support the view that certain ACAs are predictive of disease progression independently of Sokal or ELTS scores.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:38","2022-09-06 19:01:38","","1102-1109","","4","5","","Blood Adv.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: American Society of Hematology","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\D85GXBPE\Clark R.E. et al. - 2021 - Additional chromosomal abnormalities at chronic my.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011277498","article; female; human; major clinical study; male; progression free survival; outcome assessment; *risk factor; priority journal; survival rate; disease association; long term survival; *chronic myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; cytogenetics; high risk patient; risk assessment; correlational study; survival; *cancer growth; *chromosome aberration/di [Diagnosis]; *chronic myeloid leukemia/ep [Epidemiology]; *disease exacerbation/di [Diagnosis]; *predictive value; chromosome 17q; diagnostic value; European Treatment and Outcome Study score; freedom from progression; monosomy 7/di [Diagnosis]; Sokal score; trisomy 19/di [Diagnosis]; trisomy 21/di [Diagnosis]; trisomy 8/di [Diagnosis]; trisomy/di [Diagnosis]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)-based post-remission therapy would improve outcomes of this entity. We examined the frequency and long-term outcomes of adults with Ph-like ALL, particularly focusing on allo-HCT outcomes for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL. Ph-like ALL was determined by anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 344 patients, 57 (16.6%) had Ph-like ALL, 197 (57.3%) had Ph-positive ALL, and 90 (26.1%) had B-other ALL. To further evaluate the prognosis of Ph-like ALL, outcome analyses were restricted to 147 patients, excluding Ph-positive ALL. The actual allo-HCT rates in complete remission were 87.7% for Ph-like ALL, 71.4% for B-other standard-risk ALL, and 70.4% for B-other poor-risk ALL. Patients with Ph-like ALL had a higher 5-year overall survival (60.6% vs 27.1%; P = 0.008) than B-other poor-risk ALL subgroup, while no difference was observed compared with B-other standard-risk ALL subgroup. Similar results were noted in a separate analysis for patients receiving allo-HCT in complete remission. In multivariate analyses, B-other poor-risk ALL was associated with poorer outcomes. Our data showed that allo-HCT-based post-remission therapy may have contributed to non-inferior outcomes of adult Ph-like ALL.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:38","2022-09-06 19:01:38","","1953-1963","","8","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\VDWDTGC8\Cho H. et al. - 2021 - Non-inferior long-term outcomes of adults with Phi.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011081353","adult; aged; article; comparative study; controlled study; cyclosporine/dt [Drug Therapy]; female; graft versus host reaction/dt [Drug Therapy]; human; major clinical study; male; mycophenolate mofetil/dt [Drug Therapy]; retrospective study; salvage therapy; tacrolimus/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; adolescent; cancer prognosis; cyclosporine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; graft versus host reaction/co [Complication]; melphalan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy]; methotrexate/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; myeloablative conditioning; reduced intensity conditioning; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; mycophenolate mofetil/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; graft versus host reaction/pc [Prevention]; *acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer regression; tacrolimus/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; etoposide/dt [Drug Therapy]; induction chemotherapy; mitoxantrone/dt [Drug Therapy]; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; multiple cycle treatment; high throughput sequencing; *treatment outcome; maintenance therapy; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; dexamethasone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; prednisolone/dt [Drug Therapy]; etoposide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cytarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; daunorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; daunorubicin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; mercaptopurine/dt [Drug Therapy]; mercaptopurine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; vincristine/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; polymerase chain reaction; hydrocortisone/dt [Drug Therapy]; hydrocortisone/tl [Intrathecal Drug Administration]; disease risk assessment; methotrexate/tl [Intrathecal Drug Administration]; *Philadelphia 1 chromosome; prednisolone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; mitoxantrone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *Philadelphia 1 chromosome like acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Philadelphia 1 chromosome like acute lymphoblastic leukemia/th [Therapy]; central nervous system cancer/dt [Drug Therapy]; central nervous system cancer/pc [Prevention]; hydrocortisone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The D816V KIT mutation was significantly associated with post-transplant relapse, contrasting with other types of mutations in KIT. Pre- and post-transplant (3 months after transplant) CBFB-MYH11 MRD assessments were useful in predicting post-transplant relapse and poor survival. The optimal threshold was determined as a 2 log reduction at both time points. In multivariate analysis, the D816V KIT mutation and CBFB-MYH11 MRD assessments were independently associated with post-transplant relapse and survival. Stratification by D816V KIT and pre-transplant CBFB-MYH11 MRD status further distinguished the risk of relapse and survival. Auto-HSCT was superior to Allo-HSCT in MRD negative patients without D816V KIT, while Allo-HSCT trended to be superior to Auto-HSCT in patients with MRD positivity or the D816V KIT mutation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the differentiated prognostic value of the D816V KIT mutation in AML with CBFB-MYH11 and clarified optimal time points and thresholds for CBFB-MYH11 MRD monitoring in the setting of HSCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","2682-2689","","11","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\8W4TJ537\Cho B.-S. et al. - 2021 - Prognostic values of D816V KIT mutation and peri-t.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2013002287","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; outcome assessment; *acute myeloid leukemia/th [Therapy]; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; leukemia relapse; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer risk; *minimal residual disease; disease free survival; gene mutation; prediction; risk assessment; KIT gene; *measurable residual disease; patient monitoring; *amino acid substitution; *CBFb MYH11 gene; *tumor-related gene; aspartic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]; valine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the number of transplantations for elderly patients with AML (eAML) is increasing owing to greater availability of various graft sources together with the adoption of advanced supportive care and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, there are relatively limited data on the impact of donor type in eAML compared to younger patients. In addition, few studies have evaluated the role of pretransplantation measurable residual disease (MRD) in the elderly population. Given the lack of prospective comparative study, we retrospectively compared transplantation outcomes of elderly patient with AML receiving allo-HSCT from matched sibling donor (MSD-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD-HSCT) or haploidentical related donor (Haplo-HSCT), or autologous HSCT (Auto-HSCT). A total of 154 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 60-74) underwent MSD-HSCT (n = 41), MUD-HSCT (n = 36), Haplo-HSCT (n = 55), or Auto-HSCT (n = 22) for AML. RIC regimens were used in the majority of patients. In Haplo-HSCT, T-cell-replete peripheral blood stem cells with unique RIC regimens using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-based GVHD prophylaxis was used. In the analysis, adjustment for MRD status at the time of transplantation was performed. MRD was measured by the quantitative molecular assays of the targets, including RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, and NPM1, or WT1 in the absence of abnormalities in the aforementioned targets. At a median follow-up of 48 months, survival rates were similar between different donor types, whereas nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower in MUD-HSCT compared to MSD-HSCT (P =.002). MSD-HSCT, in which the majority of patients received a conditioning regimen not including ATG, showed more frequent severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). The major causes of non-relapse deaths in MSD-HSCT were related to cGVHD (71%), whereas infectious complications were mainly related to NRM in Haplo-HSCT (50%) or Auto-HSCT (100%). In the MUD-HSCT, GVHD (57%) and infection (43%) contributed similarly to non-relapse death. Cytomegalovirus infection was more frequent in Haplo-HSCT. In multivariate models, pre-transplant MRD-positivity was an independent risk factor for relapse (P =.001), whereas older age (P =.002) and the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (P =.009) were useful in predicting NRM. The current study demonstrated comparable outcomes after alternative and matched sibling donor HSCT in eAML aged 60 years or older, and the results also suggest the necessity for more sophisticated strategies to reduce NRM or relapse according to each donor type. The usefulness of molecular MRD assays demonstrated herein will facilitate trials for MRD-driven decision-making or risk-adaptive approaches in eAML.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","774.e1-774.e12","","9","27","","Transplant.

Here, we prospectively compared the outcomes of Haplo-HSCT with MUD-HSCT for AML in remission (n = 110) to prove non-inferiority of overall survival in Haplo-HSCT. Both groups were well balanced in factors related to biological features of AML and measurable residual disease (MRD) status by Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) assay. A unique, reduced-toxicity preparative regimen was used for Haplo-HSCT, whereas mostly-myeloablative regimen was for MUD-HSCT. Both groups showed similar patterns of neutrophil and platelet recovery, whereas delayed T-cell reconstitution in Haplo-HSCT was found compared with MUD-HSCT. No significant differences were found in acute or chronic graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) and post-transplant infectious events with an exception of EBV or CMV infection, which occurred more frequently in Haplo-HSCT. After a median follow-up of 47 months, no significant differences in overall survival (65% vs 54%, P =.146), disease-free survival (67% vs 53%, P =.142), relapse (20% vs 21%, P =.858), non-relapse mortality (14% vs 26%, P =.103), or GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (54% vs 41%, P =.138) were observed for Haplo-HSCT vs MUD-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, WT1 expression before transplantation independently predicted relapse, resulting in inferior survival. Separate analysis of unenrolled patients (n = 110) who were excluded or refused to participate in this study showed consistent results with enrolled patients.

A favorable safety profilewas observed, with a low frequency of alopecia (11%) and gastrointestinal toxicity (50%). The overall response rate after induction was 59%, and MRD,1023 was achieved in 57% of complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi) patients. Only the presence of mutated TP53 (P 5.02) or PTPN11 (P 5.004) predicted lower response in multivariate analysis. Interestingly, high-risk molecular prognosis subgroups defined by 2017 European LeukemiaNet risk stratification, including ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, were not associated with a significantly lower response rate using CPX-351.

Cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations have been widely used in the prognostic stratification of AML to assign patients into different risk categories. Nevertheless, nearly half of AML patients assigned to intermediate risk need more precise prognostic schemes. Here, 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML and control samples and 206 genes representing the intratumor heterogeneity of AML were identified. By applying a LASSO Cox regression model, we generated a 4-mRNA prognostic signature comprising KLF9, ENPP4, TUBA4A and CD247. Higher risk scores were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, complex karyotype, and adverse mutations. We then validated the prognostic value of this 4-mRNA signature in two independent cohorts. We also proved that incorporation of the 4-mRNA-based signature in the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification could enhance the predictive accuracy of survival in patients with AML. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that this signature was independent of traditional prognostic factors such as age, WBC count, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying disparate outcomes in high-risk and low-risk AML patients were explored. Therefore, our findings suggest that the 4-mRNA signature refines the risk stratification and prognostic prediction of AML patients.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","1385-1395","","11","96","","Am.

A total of 37 patients (HID-HSCT, 24; ISD-HSCT, 13) developed CNS relapse after transplantation between January 2009 and January 2019, with an incidence of 1.81%. The median time from transplantation to CNS relapse was 239 days. Pre-HSCT CNS involvement (HR 6.940, 95% CI 3.146-15.306, p <.001) was an independent risk factor for CNS relapse after allo-HSCT for AML. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for patients with CNS relapse was 60.3 +/- 8.8%, which was significantly lower than that in the controls (81.5 +/- 4.5%, p =.003). The incidence of CNS relapse was 1.64% for patients who received HID-HSCT and 2.55% for those who received ISD-HSCT (p =.193). There was no significant difference in OS between the HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT subgroups among the patients with CNS relapse. In conclusion, CNS relapse is a rare but serious complication after allo-HSCT for AML, and the incidence and outcomes of patients with CNS relapse are comparable following HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","505-516","","2","100","","Ann.

Maintenance therapy after HCT for patients with targetable mutations such as mutated IDH1 or IDH2 may improve outcomes, and clinical trials evaluating this strategy are ongoing. However, clinical outcomes of IDH1- and IDH2-mutated AML patients after HCT have not been well described. The primary objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and post-HCT outcomes of IDH-mutated AML patients. Survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality. In this multicenter retrospective analysis, 112 adult patients with IDH1- or IDH2-mutated AML who underwent HCT and did not receive an IDH inhibitor as maintenance therapy after HCT were identified at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Ohio State University. Mutation testing was performed using next-generation sequencing panels. Patient characteristics were collected retrospectively, and their survival outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The median patient age was 64.1 years. The median follow-up was 27.5 months. Among patients, 78.5% had intermediate- or adverse-risk disease by European LeukemiaNET criteria. Fifty-eight percent of patients received intensive induction chemotherapy, 82% of patients underwent HCT during first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and 34% of patients received myeloablative conditioning. Frequently detected co-mutations were DNMT3A (35.7%), NPM1 (33.1%), and FLT3-ITD (13.4%); TP53 mutations were detected in 3.6% of patients. For IDH1-mutated patients transplanted during first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 75% and 58%, respectively. For IDH2-mutated patients transplanted in first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 64% and 58%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31% and 25% for IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cohorts, respectively. Multivariable analysis suggested first CR/CRi and age <=60 was associated with improved outcomes for IDH2-mutated patients. To date, this is the largest multicenter study of outcomes of IDH-mutated AML patients after HCT. Our analysis provides important benchmarks for analysis and interpretation of results emerging from clinical trials evaluating maintenance IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor therapy for AML patients after HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","479.e1-479.e7","","6","27","","Transplant.

Nonetheless, >70% of adult survivors do not meet survivorship dietary recommendations. ALL treatment may amplify risk for restricted dietary preferences (picky eating) and poor self-regulation of food intake that could contribute to suboptimal diets in survivorship. This study aims to: (a) characterize differences in picky eating and self-regulation of food intake between survivors and peer controls; and (b) examine the associations between these eating behaviors and dietary quality in ALL survivors relative to peer controls. Method(s): Participants were children (5-13 years) with (n = 32) and without (n = 32) a history of ALL and their caregivers. Children's dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015) was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Caregivers completed the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Food Fussiness subscale and the Child Self-Regulation in Eating Questionnaire. Result(s): Independent samples t-tests revealed survivors exhibited greater picky eating than peer controls but comparable self-regulation of food intake. Bootstrapped grouped multivariate regression results showed that for ALL survivors, greater picky eating was associated with worse dietary quality (controlling for age and self-regulation of food intake). For peer controls, worse self-regulation of food intake was associated with poorer dietary quality (controlling for picky eating and age). Conclusion(s): Results provide preliminary support that different eating behaviors contribute to poor dietary quality in children with and without an ALL history. These findings suggest that interventions to improve ALL survivors' dietary quality may benefit targeting picky eating.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","e28811","","4","68","","Pediatr.

The analysis included all first HSCTs performed from 2000 to 2015 in adult and pediatric patients with a non-leukemic disease and recorded in the EBMT registry. Overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse mortality (RM) were evaluated. Candidemia was diagnosed in 420 of 49,852 patients at a median time of 17 days post HSCT (range 0-100), the cumulative incidence being 0.85%. In 65.5% of episodes, candidemia occurred by day 30 after HSCT. The mortality rate by day 7 was 6.2%, whereas 100-day NRM was higher (HR 3.47, p < 0.0001), and 100-day OS was lower (HR 3.22, p < 0.0001) than that of patients without candidemia.

In AML, a higher number of drivers worsens prognosis. The Shannon Index is a robust metric of clonal heterogeneity that accounts for the number of clones, but also their relative abundance. We show that a Shannon Index can be estimated from bulk sequencing, which is correlated (rho = 0.76) with clonal diversity from single-colony genotyping. In a discovery cohort of 292 patients with sequencing of 43 genes, a higher number of drivers (HR = 1.18, P = 0.028) and a lower Shannon Index (HR = 0.68, P = 0.048), the latter reflecting clonal dominance, are independently associated with worse OS independently of European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk. These findings are validated in an independent cohort of 1184 patients with 111-gene sequencing (number of drivers HR = 1.16, P = 1 x 10-5, Shannon Index HR = 0.81, P = 0.007). By re-interrogating paired diagnosis/relapse exomes from 50 cytogenetically normal AMLs, we find clonal dominance at diagnosis to be correlated with the gain of a significantly higher number of mutations at relapse (P = 6 x 10-6), hence with clonal sweeping. Our results suggest that clonal dominance at diagnosis is associated with the presence of a leukemic phenotype allowing rapid expansion of new clones and driving relapse after chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:39","2022-09-06 19:01:39","","712-723","","3","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\P4S8LE76\Cerrano M. et al. - 2021 - Clonal dominance is an adverse prognostic factor i.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2005291762","adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; middle aged; priority journal; *cancer chemotherapy; cancer specific survival; leukemia relapse; genotype; *acute myeloid leukemia; gene mutation; gene sequence; *cancer prognosis; correlational study; genetic variability; *clone; exome; genetic parameters; Shannon index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the disease characteristics and prognosis of these patients. In this study, we examined 214 patients diagnosed with MM at age <=40 years over 15 years, in the era of modern treatments. Among them, 189 patients had symptomatic MM. Disease characteristics were similar to older patients: 35% had anemia, 17% had renal impairment, and 13% had hypercalcemia. The staging was ISS-1 in 52.4%, ISS-2 in 27.5%, and ISS-3 in 20.1%. Overall, 18% of patients had high-risk cytogenetics [del 17p and/or t(4;14)]. Ninety percent of patients received intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant, and 25% of patients had allogeneic stem cell transplant predominantly at time of relapse. The median follow-up was 76 months, the estimated median overall survival was 14.5 years, and the median progression free-survival was 41 months. In multivariate analysis, bone lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 3.95; P = .01), high ISS score (HR, 2.14; P = .03), and high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 4.54; P < .0001) were significant risk factors for poor outcomes. Among predefined time-dependent covariables, onset of progression (HR, 13.2; P < .0001) significantly shortened overall survival. At 5 years, relative survival compared with same age- and sex-matched individuals was 83.5%, and estimated standardized mortality ratio was 69.9 (95% confidence interval, 52.7-91.1), confirming that MM dramatically shortens the survival of young patients despite an extended survival after diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 American Society of Hematology","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","2686-2695","","25","138","","Blood","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\AB5AJWLK\Caulier A. et al. - 2021 - Epidemiological landscape of young patients with m.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2016026015","*multiple myeloma/th [Therapy]; adult; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; bone lesion; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; follow up; treatment outcome; treatment response; cancer patient; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; clinical outcome; risk factor; etoposide/cb [Drug Combination]; etoposide/dt [Drug Therapy]; induction chemotherapy; *multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy]; bortezomib/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer diagnosis; cytogenetics; cancer growth; cancer staging; autologous stem cell transplantation; lenalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; maintenance therapy; bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]; dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]; International Staging System; prednisone/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/dt [Drug Therapy]; doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; lenalidomide/cb [Drug Combination]; prednisone/cb [Drug Combination]; thalidomide/cb [Drug Combination]; thalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/cb [Drug Combination]; consolidation chemotherapy; France; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; cancer epidemiology; bortezomib/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; cyclophosphamide/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; dexamethasone/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; anemia; glomerulus filtration rate; clinical assessment tool; doxorubicin/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; etoposide/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; hypercalcemia; iss score; lenalidomide/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; prednisone/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; proteinuria; severe renal impairment; standardized mortality ratio; thalidomide/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]; vincristine/tm [Unexpected Outcome of Drug Treatment]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the absence of these features, uncertainties to identify the secondary nature of some cases, otherwise defined as de novo AML, remain. In order to test whether a chromatin-spliceosome (CS) mutational signature might better define the de novo AML group, we analyzed a prospective cohort of 413 newly diagnosed AML patients who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial (NILG AML 02/06) and who provided samples for accurate cytogenetic and molecular characterization. Among clinically defined de novo AML, 17.6% carried CS mutations (CS-AML) and showed clinical characteristics closer to sAML (older age, lower white blood cell counts and higher rate of multilineage dysplasia). Outcomes in this group were adverse, more similar to those of sAML as compared to de novo AML (overall survival, 30% in CS-AML and 17% in sAML vs. 61% in de novo AML, P<0.0001; disease-free survival, 26% in CS-AML and 22% in sAML vs. 54% of de novo AML, P<0.001) and independently confirmed by multivariable analysis. Allogeneic transplant in first complete remission improved survival in both sAML and CS-AML patients. In conclusion, these findings highlight the clinical significance of identifying CS-AML for improved prognostic prediction and potential therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2021 Ferrata Storti Foundation","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","2578-2587","","10","106","","Haematologica","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Italy Publisher: Ferrata Storti Foundation","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\U8KZJLV9\Caprioli C. et al. - 2021 - Clinical significance of chromatin-spliceosome acu.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2014886237","adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; progression free survival; multicenter study; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; acute myeloid leukemia; follow up; cancer patient; risk factor; karyotype; prevalence; high throughput sequencing; leukocyte count; gene mutation; remission; bone marrow; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; blood cell count; cytarabine; hemoglobin; secondary acute myeloid leukemia; mutational analysis; Sanger sequencing; idarubicin; genetic analysis; cell differentiation; *chromatin; *spliceosome; etoposide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, no data have been reported on the management of dyslipidemia in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with nilotinib. We investigated 369 CML adult patients, stratified according to the new Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring system. Plasma levels of cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were measured prior to the start of nilotinib and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence of AOEs was 15.9%. Patients with cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dL and LDL > 70 mg/dL 3 months after treatment showed a significantly higher incidence of AOEs (21.9 +/- 4.6% vs 6.2 +/- 2.5, P = 0.003). Patients belonging to the high and very high SCORE risk group showed a significant increase of AOEs (34.4 +/- 6% vs 10 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, both high cholesterol and LDL levels and a high and very high SCORE risk remained significantly associated with the risk of AOEs (P = 0.008; HR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4-8.7 and P < 0.001; HR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2-9.8, respectively). Overall, 78 patients (21.1%) presented dyslipidemia at the time of CML diagnosis and 88 (23.3%) after starting nilotinib, but only 26 of them (29.5%) were treated with statins. Low LDL and cholesterol plasma levels are associated with a significant lower risk of AOEs in CML patients treated with nilotinib in the real life.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","2005-2014","","8","100","","Ann.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical correlation and distribution of circulating T-lymphocyte subsets in newly diagnosed WM patients. We retrospectively searched medical records for 86 newly diagnosed WM patients. Comparisons of the absolute CD3+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD3C), CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD4C), CD8+ T-lymphocyte count (ACD8C), and CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio (CD4+/CD8+) as continuous parameters in different groups were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Young patients (<65 years) had lower ACD8C levels and a higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio. And the lower level of beta2-microglobulin (<3 mg/L) was associated with a higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio. With a median follow-up of 25 months, the univariate survival analysis showed that CD4+/CD8+ ratio inversion (CD4+/CD8+<1.5) was associated with shorter OS and PFS, and multivariate analysis confirmed that inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio could be an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Additionally, initial treatment with rituximab or bortezomib significantly improved the PFS and OS of CD4+/CD8+ inversion patients but did not affect normal CD4+/CD8+ patients. We show that low circulating CD4+/CD8+ ratio at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor in WM patients and that first-line therapy which included rituximab or bortezomib significantly improved PFS and OS for patients with CD4+/CD8+ ratio less than 1.5.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","995-1002","","4","100","","Ann.

We investigated the impact of HLA heterozygosity, supertypes, and surface expression on outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent 8/8 HLA-matched, T cell replete, unrelated, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) from 2000 to 2015 using patient data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. HLA class I heterozygosity and HLA expression were not associated with overall survival, relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and acute graft-versus-host disease following HCT. The HLA-B62 supertype was associated with decreased TRM in the entire patient cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90; P = .00053). The HLA-B27 supertype was associated with worse DFS in patients with AML (HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.32; P = .00005). These findings suggest that the survival benefit of HLA heterozygosity seen in solid tumor patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors does not extend to patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. Certain HLA supertypes, however, are associated with TRM and DFS, suggesting that similarities in peptide presentation between supertype members play a role in these outcomes. Beyond implications for prognosis following HCT, these findings support the further investigation of these HLA supertypes and the specific immune peptides important for transplant outcomes.

Lenalidomide has recently emerged as a therapeutic option for POEMS syndrome. Cereblon has been identified as the direct target of lenalidomide, and high cereblon expression is associated with better response and outcome to lenalidomide therapy in multiple myeloma patients. Here, we analyzed the predictive value of cereblon, IKZF1, and IKZF3 in CD138+ selected plasma cells from forty-one newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone at both gene and protein levels. We found that patients with high cereblon expression tended to achieve better hematologic response compared to those with low expression (p = 0.024 for gene expression; p = 0.01 for protein expression). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed high cereblon mRNA expression as an independent prognostic marker for longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.542; 95% CI 0.337-0.871; p = 0.011). In conclusion, our results emphasized the role of cereblon mRNA expression as a unique biomarker for predicting the clinical response and outcome of lenalidomide-based therapy in newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","1547-1552","","6","100","","Ann.

The lack of data from Asian patients led us to conduct this study. Method(s): We retrospectively studied outcomes of 106 patients in CR1 undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) based on their exposure to pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy. There were 35 in the no consolidation group versus 71 in the consolidation group. Result(s): The median relapse free survival (RFS) was 9 months for the no consolidation group and 51 months for consolidation group (p = 0.023). The median overall survival was 32 months for the no consolidation group and not reached for the consolidation group (p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis recognized consolidation and poor cytogenetics as adverse prognostic factors for RFS. Moreover, RFS was better in patients with a shorter time lapse between last chemotherapy and alloSCT in both the no consolidation group and the consolidation group. Consolidation chemotherapy did not negatively affect neutrophil and platelet engraftment, infection rates, or acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence. On the other hand, patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy showed trends towards a more severe degree of chronic GVHD. Conclusion(s): The exposure to consolidation chemotherapy in CR1 prior to alloSCT with RIC conditioning did not negatively impact the outcomes in Korean AML patients, for whom a suitable donor is rarely immediately available. Therefore, post-remission consolidation chemotherapy is a reasonable option if required.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","","","(Byun, Shin, Koh, Hong, Kim, Yoon) Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea","12","","Ther.

The present study aimed to assess the association of statin use with mortality in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We identified all incident NHLs and CLLs in Sweden from 2007 to 2013 with subtype information in the Swedish Lymphoma and Cancer Registers. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of pre- or post-diagnosis statin use (yes/no, intensity) with lymphoma-specific, cardiovascular, or all-cause mortality; and for follicular lymphoma (FL) by initial treatment strategy (active/watch-and-wait). Among 16 098 incident NHL/CLL patients, 20% used statins at diagnosis. Pre- and post-diagnosis statin use, and statin intensity were not consistently associated with any mortality outcome in patients with NHL, overall or for any subtype. For actively treated patients with FL, statin use did not appear to increase lymphoma-specific mortality (vs. non-users, HR [95% CI]after diagnosis 0.87 [0.45-1.67]). For CLL, statin use was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular but not consistently with lymphoma-specific mortality. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with improved lymphoma survival but appears safe to use during lymphoma treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The present study aimed to determine whether venetoclax is effective and well tolerated in patients with CLL or Richter's syndrome (RS) in a real-world setting and to highlight factors impacting survival. Data from a venetoclax French compassionate use program were collected for 67 patients (60 with CLL and 7 with RS).

Tumor lysis syndrome was observed in 14 (22%) patients, and 16 (24%) patients were hospitalized for grade III/IV infection. In the CLL cohort, ORR was 75 %, 1-year PFS was 61% (95% CI = 47-72%) and 1-year OS 70% (95% CI = 56-80%). No impact of TP53 disruption was noted while complex karyotype was identified as a predictor of both inferior PFS (HR = 3.46; 95% CI = 1-12; log-rank p = 0.03) and OS (HR = 3.2; 95% CI = 0.9-11.4, log-rank p = 0.047).

Although deaths during the first year after transplantation are often attributable to treatment toxicities and complications, death after the first year may be due to sequelae of accelerated aging caused by cellular senescence. Cytotoxic therapies and radiation used in cancer treatments and conditioning regimens for HCT can induce aging at the molecular level; HCT patients experience time-dependent effects, such as frailty and aging-associated diseases, more rapidly than people who have not been exposed to these treatments. Consistent with this, recipients of younger cells tend to have decreased markers of aging and improved survival, decreased graft-versus-host disease, and lower relapse rates. Given that umbilical cord blood (UCB) is the youngest donor source available, we studied the outcomes after the first year of UCB transplantation versus matched related donor (MRD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies over a 20-year period. In this single-center, retrospective study, we examined the outcomes of all adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic HCT through the Duke Adult Bone Marrow Transplant program from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015, to allow for at least 3 years of follow-up. Patients were excluded if they died or were lost to follow-up before day 365 after HCT, received an allogeneic HCT for a disease other than a hematologic malignancy, or received cells from a haploidentical or mismatched adult donor. UCB recipients experienced a better unadjusted overall survival than MRD/MUD recipients (log rank P = .03, median overall survival: UCB not reached, MRD/MUD 7.4 years). After adjusting for selected covariates, UCB recipients who survived at least 1 year after HCT had a hazard of death that was 31% lower than that of MRD/MUD recipients (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.99; P = .049). This trend held true in a subset analysis of subjects with acute leukemia. UCB recipients also experienced lower rates of moderate or severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and nonrelapse mortality, and slower time to relapse. UCB and MRD/MUD recipients experienced similar rates of grade 2-4 acute GVHD, chronic GHVD, secondary malignancy, and subsequent allogeneic HCT. UCB is already widely used as a donor source in pediatric HCT; however, adult outcomes and adoption have historically lagged behind in comparison. Recent advancements in UCB transplantation such as the implementation of lower-intensity conditioning regimens, double unit transplants, and ex vivo expansion have improved early mortality, making UCB an increasingly attractive donor source for adults; furthermore, our findings suggest that UCB may actually be a preferred donor source for mitigating late effects of HCT.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","669.e1-669.e8","","8","27","","Transplant.

All-cause mortality survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between demographic/clinical factors and all-cause mortality. Hispanic/Latino patients experienced 52% lower risk of mortality compared to NHWs (HR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.28-0.83), after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors. This reduced risk experienced by Hispanics/Latinos was similarly observed by age at diagnosis (<=60 years, >60 years), stage (I/II, III/IV), and receipt of chemotherapy. NHBs and NHWs experienced similar risk of mortality (HR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.52-1.40). Overall, among DLBCL patients, Hispanics/Latinos had improved survival compared to NHWs.

Maintenance treatment with FLT3 inhibitors and hypomethylating agents (HMA) has been studied in various clinical trials with mixed results. Objective(s): To synthesize the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of FLT3 inhibitors and HMA for maintenance therapy after allo-HCT in AML and MDS. Method(s): For this systematic review and meta-analysis Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception to March 2021 for studies on maintenance therapies after allo-HCT in AML and MDS. Studies were excluded if they were reviews, commentaries, case series with <5 patients, or basic research articles, not published in English, not on post-allo-HCT maintenance with FLT3 inhibitors or HMA in AML or MDS, or if they were clinical trials without published results or duplicate publications from the same patient cohort. Studies with insufficient reporting of the primary endpoint (2-year overall survival [OS]) and studies using FLT3 inhibitors or HMA for pre-emptive treatment of imminent relapse based on positive measurable residual disease testing were excluded. Random-effects models were used to pool response rates for the primary outcome of 2-year OS. Hazard ratios (HR) for death and relapse were calculated for studies that included a control group. Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were studied as secondary endpoints. Downs and Black checklist and risk of bias assessments were used to gauge the quality of individual studies. The study protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020187298). Result(s): Our search strategy identified 5559 studies. Twenty-one studies with a total of 809 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The 2-year OS rates were 81.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.8%-87.7%) and 65.7% (95% CI, 55.1%-74.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. In sensitivity analyses restricted to studies that included a control group, maintenance therapy with FLT3 inhibitors (HR for death = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.62) or HMA (HR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.66) appeared superior to no maintenance therapy. The 2-year RFS rates were 79.8% (95% CI, 75.0%-83.9%) and 62.4% (95% CI, 50.6%-72.9%) among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors and HMA, respectively. Rates of any grade acute and chronic GVHD were 33.1% (95% CI, 25.4%-41.8%; grade 3/4: 16.5%) and 42.5% (95% CI, 26.3%-60.4%) among FLT3 inhibitor and 42.7% (95% CI, 33.5%-52.4%; grade 3/4: 8.1%) and 41.5% (95% CI, 32.0%-51.6%) among HMA-treated patients, respectively. Conclusion(s): Maintenance therapy with either FLT3 inhibitors or HMA after allo-HCT can lead to prolonged and improved OS and RFS with a favorable safety profile. Additional studies are needed to define the optimal duration of treatment, the role of measurable residual disease status, and transplant characteristics in patient selection.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:40","2022-09-06 19:01:40","","997.e1-997.e11","","12","27","","Transplant.

Among the donors, 51.2% were matched related donors (MRD) while the remainder were alternative donors. Most patients received a fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy)-based conditioning regimen (86.6%) and in vivo T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab (69.5%). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 85.4% [70.4-93.2] with MRD, 95.7% [72.9-99.4] with matched unrelated donors (MUD), 44.4% [6.6-78.5] with mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD) and 44.4% [13.6-71.9] with mismatched related donors (MMRD) (P < 0.001). Other factors significantly impacting OS were pre-transplant bone marrow status, source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, preparation with Flu-Cy, use of total body irradiation (TBI) and alemtuzumab as serotherapy. In multivariate analysis, absence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukaemia, bone marrow as source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) other than +/- (Recipient/Donor) and Flu-Cy were protective factors for five-year OS. Five-year chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD)-free event-free survival was 75.4% with the same risk factors except for CMV serostatus. Five-year non-relapse mortality was 13.8% [7.3-22.3].

However, disease-specific risk factors in AML/MDS can further inform when MAC and RIC may yield differential outcomes. We analyzed HCT outcomes stratified by the Disease Risk Index (DRI) in 4387 adults (age 40 to 65 years) to identify the impact of conditioning intensity. In the low/intermediate-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR], .74; 95% confidence interval [CI], .62 to .88; P < .001) but significantly greater relapse risk (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.76; P < .001) and thus inferior disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.33; P = .001). In the high/very high-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with marginally lower NRM (HR, .83; 95% CI, .68 to 1.00; P = .051) and significantly higher relapse risk (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.41; P = .002), leading to similar DFS using either RIC or MAC. These data support MAC over RIC as the preferred conditioning intensity for patients with AML/MDS with low/intermediate-risk DRI, but with a similar benefit as RIC in high/very high-risk DRI. Novel MAC regimens with less toxicity could benefit all patients, but more potent antineoplastic approaches are needed for the high/very-high risk DRI group.

Treatment included intensive (n = 766) or lower intensity (n = 144) chemotherapy or supportive care (n = 213), with respective median survivals of 22, 9, and 2 months (p < 0.01). Intensive chemotherapy resulted in complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates of 44 and 33%, respectively, with no difference in survival outcome between the two (p = 0.4). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) was documented in 259 patients and provided the best survival rate (median 55 months; p < 0.01).

Triggering event(s) of such complications vary significantly, but often a so-called ""multi-organ failure"" (MOF) is reported as the leading cause of death. The identification of the exact trigger of MOF is critical towards early and disease-specific intervention to improve outcome. We examined data from 202 alloHCT patients reported to have died of MOF from the EBMT registry aiming to determine their exact cause of death focusing on veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) due to its life-threatening, often difficult to capture yet preventable nature. We identified a total of 70 patients (35%) for whom VOD/SOS could be considered as trigger for MOF and leading cause of death, among which 48 (69%) were previously undiagnosed. Multivariate analysis highlighted history of hepatic comorbidity or gentuzumab use and disease status beyond CR1 as the only significant factors predictive of VOD/SOS incidence (OR = 6.6; p = 0.001 and OR = 3.3; p = 0.004 respectively). VOD/SOS-related MOF was widely under-reported, accounting for 27% of deaths attributed to MOF of unknown origin without a previous VOD/SOS diagnosis. Our results suggest most missed cases developed late VOD/SOS beyond 21 days post-alloHCT, highlighting the importance of the newly revised EBMT criteria.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:41","2022-09-06 19:01:41","","917-927","","4","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\288JWNIH\Bazarbachi A.H. et al. - 2021 - Underdiagnosed veno-occlusive diseasesinusoidal o.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2007324568","*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; adult; aged; article; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; incidence; comorbidity; cancer patient; prediction; *acute leukemia/th [Therapy]; cause of death; register; *liver venoocclusive disease; *vein occlusion; deterioration; health status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For intermediate cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in first complete remission (CR1), multivariate analysis revealed that haplo-TBF significantly increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.1; p = 0.0006) but did not affect relapse incidence (RI), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), or graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS). For high cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1, haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR = 2.7; p = 0.02), decreased RI (HR = 0.45; p = 0.03) but had no influence on LFS, OS, or GRFS.

In conclusion, compared to MUD-FB, haplo-TBF increased NRM, reduced RI in high-risk AML in CR, resulting in similar LFS, OS, and GRFS.

Therefore, we performed a landmark study comparing long-term outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients alive and disease-free 2 years after transplantation who received grafts from either CBT or UD. A total of 364 CBT recipients, 2648 UD 10/10 patients and 681 patients given grafts from UD 9/10 were included. Median follow-up was 6.0 years.

On multivariate analysis, donor type had no impact on LFS. Similarly, no impact of donor type was observed on relapse incidence or non-relapse mortality. Factors associated with poorer LFS on multivariate analysis included higher age at transplantation (P < 0.001), male gender (P < 0.001), second complete remission (CR2) versus CR1 (P = 0.05), secondary AML (P = 0.01), antecedent of chronic GVHD (P < 0.001) and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.01).

BNT162b2 mRNA COVID19 (BNT162b2) vaccine provides effective protection against COVID19 for the general population, yet its effect in MM patients may be compromised due to disease and therapy-related factors and was not yet evaluated. This single-centre prospective study included MM patients tested for serological response 14-21 days post second vaccine. Vaccinated healthy volunteers served as controls. In all, 171 MM patients, median age 70 (38-94) were included; 159 active MM and 12 smouldering myeloma (SMM). Seropositive response rate (median titer) was 76% (91 U/ml) in active MM patients vs 98% (992 U/ml) in the 64 controls (P < 0.0001), and 100% (822 U/ml) in SMM patients. Multivariate analysis revealed older age (P = 0.009), exposure to >=4 novel anti-myeloma drugs (P = 0.02) and hypogammaglobulinaemia (P = 0.002) were associated with lower response rates. None of the novel agents significantly decreased response rate, whereas daratumumab trended towards reduced response (P = 0.08). Adverse events occurred in 53% and 55% of the MM patients and controls, respectively, all transient grade 1-2. In conclusion, BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and provided a high seropositivity rate in MM patients, independent of treatment type. Older, hypogammaglobulinaemic and heavily pretreated patients had lower response rates.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","186-193","","2","195","","Br.

The phase 3 BOSTON study showed that once-weekly selinexor and bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone (XVd) improved PFS and ORR compared with standard twice-weekly bortezomib and moderate-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with previously treated MM. This is a retrospective subgroup analysis of the multicenter, prospective, randomized BOSTON trial. Post hoc analyses were performed to compare XVd versus Vd safety and efficacy according to age and frailty status (<65 and >=65 years, nonfrail and frail). Patients >=65 years with XVd had higher ORR (OR 1.77, p =.024), >=VGPR (OR, 1.68, p =.027), PFS (HR 0.55, p =.002), and improved OS (HR 0.63, p =.030), compared with Vd. In frail patients, XVd was associated with a trend towards better PFS (HR 0.69, p =.08) and OS (HR 0.62, p =.062). Significant improvements were also observed in patients <65 (ORR and TTNT) and nonfrail patients (PFS, ORR, >=VGPR, and TTNT). Patients treated with XVd had a lower incidence of grade >= 2 peripheral neuropathy in >=65 year-old (22% vs. 37%; p =.0060) and frail patients (15% vs. 44%; p =.0002). Grade >=3 TEAEs were not observed more often in older compared to younger patients, nor in frail compared to nonfrail patients.

Barring the transient worsening in QoL one-month after ASCT, there was a comparable improvement in most QoL domains in both early-ASCT and no-early ASCT cohorts. Post-early-ASCT patients had higher global health scores (71.9 vs. 60.8, p <.05) than no-early ASCT at 12-months. Patients belonging to lower socioeconomic status (SES) were more likely not to undergo ASCT than middle-high SES patients (38.6% vs. 74.5%, p <.05).

Due to the abundance of novel treatments for MM, we conducted a network meta-analysis to identify combinations that could fare better than others in relapsed/refractory MM, in the setting of novel drugs. We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for phase III trials in previously treated MM that had lenalidomide or bortezomib in the control arm. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), extracted as hazard-ratio. We used the P score to rank treatments. Thirteen studies were included. All but two studies compared one novel agent against two, with or without dexamethasone. Based on the P score, daratumumab and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin had a higher probability of achieving better PFS, followed by isatuximab, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and panobinostat. Although most overall survival data were not mature enough, the addition of a second or third novel agent to either immunomodulatory (IMID) or proteasome inhibitor (PI) backbone seemed to improve survival (HR = 0.84, 95CI 0.77-0.92). Severe adverse events were more frequent with isatuximab, panobinostat, and pomalidomide. In summary, in the absence of trials directly comparing two novel agents-based therapies, we provide a tool that indirectly compares these newer therapies and that can help physicians to prioritize some regimens over others.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","725-734","","3","100","","Ann.

Risk assessment tools and outcomes of AF in these patients are not well described. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib at Mayo Clinic between October 2012 and November 2018. Result(s): Two hundred ninety-eight patients were identified with a median time on ibrutinib of 19 months (range 0.23-69.7 months). Fifty-one patients developed treatment-emergent AF; the risk of treatment-emergent AF at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years was 9%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of treatment-emergent AF on multivariable analyses: past history of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, p = 0.0072) and heart failure (HR 3.4, p = 0.0028). Most patients are able to continue ibrutinib therapy (dose reduced in 43%). Development of treatment-emergent AF was associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS; HR 2.0, p = 0.02) and shorter overall survival (OS; HR 3.2, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, prior treatment status, TP53 disruption, heart failure, valvular disease, and past history of AF. Conclusion(s): Patient comorbidities, rather than CLL-related factors, predict risk of treatment-emergent AF in patients treated with ibrutinib. Although the vast majority of patients with treatment-emergent AF are able to continue ibrutinib (with dose reduction in 43%), treatment-emergent AF appears to be associated with worse outcomes, independent of other adverse prognostic factors.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","143-155","","1","100","","Ann.

We report on the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in AML patients treated outside of clinical trials. Complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) were achieved in 61% of patients, with similar CR+CRi rates in with secondary AML, and in patients who were previously treated with HMA (61% and 43%, respectively). Relapse occurred in 25% of patients, with a median event-free survival (EFS) of 11.7 months (95% CI, 10.09-13.35) in responding patients. At a median follow up of 8.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months (95% CI 6.42-13.3) in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis adverse karyotype was the only negative predictor of CR/CRi (p =.03), while both ECOG performance status (PS) and adverse karyotype were significantly associated with shorter OS (p =.023 and.038, respectively). Median OS was higher in patients achieving CR/CRi and in patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Treatment was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those described in the randomized clinical trials. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 12% of patients. Our data support the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in newly diagnosed AML patients not eligible for intensive therapy. According to our data, secondary AML patients could benefit from venetoclax combinations similarly to de-novo AML patients, and allo-SCT could be offered to selected patients achieving CR/CRi.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","790-795","","7","96","","Am.

Here, we confirmed CALCRL expression as a prognostic factor in a cohort of 284 pediatric patients with AML. High CALCRL expression was independently associated with event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.57; P 5 .0001), overall survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.27; P 5 .025), and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.49-1.96; P, .0001) when adjusting for age, white blood cell count, and genetic risk. Despite its association with leukemia stem cell signatures, CALCRL expression remained associated with all end points when compared with the 17-gene leukemic stem cell score. The strong association of CALCRL expression with the risk of relapse also in the pediatric population supports its role as novel age-independent master regulator of relapse-initiating, drug-tolerant AML cells in humans.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

In addition, majority of patients at this early point are unable to withstand intensive salvage chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the combination of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and venetoclax may result in increased response in this difficult to treat patient group. We retrospectively analyzed 22 patients from February 2017-December 2019, who were given the Venetoclax/DLI combination. Median age was 65 (43-75) years. There were no cases of tumor lysis syndrome. Microbiology documented infections occurred in 8 patients (36%). Majority were able to tolerate the protocol without admissions. Acute GVHD was observed in 4 (18%) patients and cGVHD was observed in 6 (27%) patients. Overall response was observed in 11 (50%) patients (CR, n = 4; CRi, n = 1; CRp, n = 4; MLFS n = 2). Median time to response was 28 (18-67) days and median cycles of venetoclax 2 [1-8] and duration of response were 135 (31-564) days. Median survival was 6.1 months (95% CI.73-11.4). Cox regression model for survival showed decreased WBC at relapse, GVHD and better performance status were associated with better survival.

Care at specialized cancer centers (SCC: Children's Oncology Group affiliated and/or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center) has been found to improve outcomes in patients with leukemia, but studies have not considered location of care and outcomes in EWS and OS patients, an ideal group to evaluate given their specialized multidisciplinary treatment needs. Method(s): Patients hospitalized with primary EWS and OS (2000-2014) were identified using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were divided into age groups (0-18, 19-39, >=40 years), and classified on whether they received all versus part/none of their inpatient treatment at a SCC within 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with survival. Result(s): There were 531 ES and 959 OS patients. Five-year overall survival was better for patients with EWS (all: 63% vs. part/none: 42%) and OS (all: 64% vs. part/none: 47%) who received all of their treatment at a SCC. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, receiving all inpatient cancer treatment at a SCC was associated with superior overall survival (EWS HR: 0.49, CI 0.37-0.67; OS HR: 0.78, CI 0.63-0.97). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that treatment for EWS and OS at a SCC is associated with significantly improved survival even after adjustment for known prognostic factors. The superior survival among those treated at SCCs may be due to having greater access to clinical trials and services at SCCs.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","e28998","","7","68","","Pediatr.

A period analysis was performed to estimate 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for patients diagnosed during different calendar periods from 1985 to 2015. A mixture cure model was used to examine long-term survivors' proportions among patients diagnosed in 1985-2015 and for two cohorts diagnosed in 2000-2003, followed up to 2012 and 2004-2007, and followed up to 2015. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for the two cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death adjusted for gender and age. The 5-year and 10-year age-adjusted relative survival rate ranged between 73.7 and 89.4% and from 51.6% to ""not reached,"" respectively, for calendar periods of 1985-1989 to 2010-2014. The long-term survivor proportions varied by age and gender from 0 to 59%.

Prospective study to characterise the CVD and to identify predictors for the combined event (CE) cardiovascular event and/or all-cause mortality in transfusion dependent low-risk MDS patients. Thirty-one patients underwent a cardiac assessment including biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance (cMR) with parametric sequences (T1, T2 and T2* mapping) and myocardial deformation by feature tracking (FT) and were analysed for clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential mutations. Cardiac assessment revealed high prevalence of unknown structural heart disease (51% cMR pathological findings). After 2.2 [0.44] years follow-up, 35.5% of patients suffered the CE: 16% death, 29% cardiovascular event. At multivariate analysis elevated NT-proBNP >= 486pg/ml (HR 96.7; 95%-CI 1.135-8243; P = 0.044), reduced native T1 time < 983ms (HR 44.8; 95%-CI 1.235-1623; P = 0.038) and higher left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) (HR 0.4; 95%-CI 0.196-0.973; P = 0.043) showed an independent prognostic value. These variables, together with the myocardial T2* time < 20ms, showed an additive prognostic value (Log Rank: 12.4; P = 0.001). In conclusion, low-risk MDS patients frequently suffer CVD. NT-proBNP value, native T1 relaxation time and longitudinal strain by FT are independent predictors of poor cardiovascular prognosis, thus, their determination would identify high-risk patients who could benefit from a cardiac treatment and follow-up.Copyright © 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","536-541","","4","195","","Br.

To elucidate the effect of PTPN11 mutations (PTPN11mut) on clinical outcomes, we screened adult patients with AML treated at our institution using targeted next-generation sequencing. Among 1406 consecutive patients, 112 (8%) had PTPN11mut. These mutations were more commonly associated with the acute myelomonocytic/monocytic leukemia subtype than was wild-type PTPN11, while none were detected in patients with core-binding factor AML. They co-occurred more commonly with NPM1 mutations and FLT3 internal tandem duplications and less commonly with mutations in IDH2 and a complex karyotype. Compared with the wild-type allele, PTPN11mut was associated with lower complete response rates (54% vs 40%; P = 0.04), and shorter overall survival (median 13.6 vs 8.4 months; P = 0.008). In a multivariate analysis, PTPN11mut independently increased the risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.25-2.29; P = 0.0007). In summary, mutations in PTPN11 have a characteristic phenotype in adults with AML and are associated with an adverse prognosis.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:42","2022-09-06 19:01:42","","691-700","","3","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\GRRHSERD\Alfayez M. et al. - 2021 - The Clinical impact of PTPN11 mutations in adults .pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2005258427","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; recurrence free survival; cancer survival; fludarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cancer combination chemotherapy; fludarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; allele; *acute myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy]; cladribine/cb [Drug Combination]; cladribine/dt [Drug Therapy]; cytarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; cytarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; idarubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; idarubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; low drug dose; high throughput sequencing; *PTPN11 gene; genetic association; cytarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; very elderly; CD135 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; idarubicin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; signal transduction; azacitidine/dt [Drug Therapy]; azacitidine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cladribine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; decitabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; decitabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; *acute myeloid leukemia/di [Diagnosis]; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; gene function; mutational analysis; clofarabine/dt [Drug Therapy]; cancer classification; *tumor gene; gene identification; clofarabine/cb [Drug Combination]; genetic analysis; clofarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cytarabine/do [Drug Dose]; genetic code","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact of each salvage therapy on transplant outcomes have not been compared. Our primary objective was to determine post-HCT relapse-free survival (RFS) in adult patients with r/r Philadelphia-chromosome negative (Phneg) B-ALL. We retrospectively studied alloHCT outcomes in 108 adult patients with r/r Phneg B-ALL transplanted in morphological remission achieved by salvage therapy. Salvage therapies were chemotherapy-based combination (n = 45, 42%), blinatumomab (n=43, 40%), inotuzumab (n = 14, 13%), or CAR T cells (n = 6, 6%). The 2-year RFS and overall survival (OS) were 44% and 50%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, conditioning with reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-3.80; P =.003), having received >=3 lines of therapies prior to transplant (HR = 2.66, 95% CI, 1.56-4.54; P <.001), and inotuzumab (HR = 2.42, 95% CI, 1.14-5.12; Wald P value =.021) were independently associated with lower RFS. Blinatumomab (HR = 1.10, 95% CI, 0.62-1.96) had comparable RFS to chemotherapy. Incidence of hepatic sinusoidal syndrome was highest with inotuzumab (P <.001); however, 30-day mortality and intensive care unit admissions were not different per salvage therapy. The alloHCT in r/r Phneg B-ALL after remission induction with blinatumomab or chemotherapy led to encouraging outcomes if morphologic CR was achieved. In contrast, pretransplantation inotuzumab therapy was associated with inferior RFS. Larger studies are warranted to confirm our observations. Early transplantation after relapse and the utilization of myeloablative conditioning, when feasible, were key factors associated with improved outcomes after alloHCT in these patients.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","255.e1-255.e9","","3","27","","Transplant.

We investigated the prognostic value of the PTSS in a cohort of patients with MDS who underwent myeloablative CD34-selected TCD transplants. From 2008 to 2018, 109 patients underwent a first TCD-HCT for MDS at our center. We used Cox proportional hazards models and different landmark analyses to evaluate the association of categorized PTSS score risk groups with overall survival (OS). Patients with an intermediate/ high risk PTSS score had decreased OS at day 180 (univariate HR 3.25 [95% CI 1.60, 6.60], p = 0.001) and at day 365 (univariate HR 5.42 [95% CI 2.21, 13.3], p < 0.001) compared to low risk PTSS scores. This association remained significant after adjusting for HCT-CI. PTSS score calculated at day 100 was not associated with OS, even after adjusting for HCT-CI subgroups. In summary, the PTSS predicted survival at day 180 and day 365 in recipients of T-cell-depleted allografts for myelodysplastic syndrome.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","2749-2754","","11","56","","Bone Marrow Transplant.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature Isolex 300i: Baxter [United States]","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\6W3DKAEG\Alarcon Tomas A. et al. - 2021 - The post-transplant scoring system (PTSS) is assoc.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=2013137719","adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; retrospective study; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; human cell; mortality; T cell depletion; busulfan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; fludarabine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; melphalan/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; myeloablative conditioning; thiotepa/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; fludarabine/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; follow up; *clinical outcome; comorbidity; *myelodysplastic syndrome/th [Therapy]; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; *allogeneic stem cell transplantation; high risk population; disease exacerbation; *scoring system; relapse; low risk population; *CD34 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]; engraftment; cyclophosphamide/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; graft versus host reaction; survival prediction; melphalan/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]; *post transplant scoring system; general aspects of disease; Isolex 300i; laboratory device; magnetic cell separator; nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation; prognostic value; thiotepa/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence rates of RT among pts with CLL range from 2 to 10%. The aim of this analysis is to report the frequency, characteristics and outcomes of pts with RT enrolled in trials of the GCLLSG. A total of 2975 pts with advanced CLL were reviewed for incidence of RT. Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data were pooled. Time-to-event data, starting from time of CLL diagnosis, of first-line therapy or of RT diagnosis, were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology. One hundred and three pts developed RT (3%): 95 pts diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (92%) and eight pts Hodgkin lymphoma (8%). Median observation time was 53 months (interquartile range 38.1-69.5). Median OS from initial CLL diagnosis for pts without RT was 167 months vs 71 months for pts with RT (HR 2.64, CI 2.09-3.33). Median OS after diagnosis of RT was 9 months. Forty-seven pts (46%) received CHOP-like regimens for RT treatment. Three pts subsequently underwent allogeneic and two pts autologous stem cell transplantation. Our findings show that within a large cohort of GCLLSG trial participants, 3% of the pts developed RT after receiving first-line chemo- or chemoimmunotherapy. This dataset confirms the ongoing poor prognosis and high mortality associated with RT.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","169-176","","1","35","","Leukemia","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\efbonneville\Zotero\storage\EDIDR8LY\Al-Sawaf O. et al. - 2021 - Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leuk.pdf; ","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2004448334","adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy]; cyclophosphamide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cancer survival; priority journal; cancer incidence; cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination]; etoposide/cb [Drug Combination]; etoposide/dt [Drug Therapy]; clinical feature; prednisolone/cb [Drug Combination]; prednisolone/dt [Drug Therapy]; etoposide/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; vincristine/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination]; doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy]; vincristine/cb [Drug Combination]; very elderly; doxorubicin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; cancer genetics; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; bleomycin/cb [Drug Combination]; bleomycin/dt [Drug Therapy]; bleomycin/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; prednisolone/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; diffuse large B cell lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hodgkin disease/dt [Drug Therapy]; *chronic lymphatic leukemia/th [Therapy]; *malignant transformation; *richter transformation; dacarbazine/cb [Drug Combination]; dacarbazine/dt [Drug Therapy]; dacarbazine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; Hodgkin disease/th [Therapy]; large cell lymphoma/th [Therapy]; procarbazine/cb [Drug Combination]; procarbazine/dt [Drug Therapy]; procarbazine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]; vinblastine/cb [Drug Combination]; vinblastine/dt [Drug Therapy]; vinblastine/pv [Special Situation for Pharmacovigilance]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study evaluated the prognostic value of the Fibrinogen-Albumin Ratio Index (FARI) at the diagnosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) treated with azacitidine (AZA). A retrospective study was conducted in a single cohort of 99 patients with de novo MDS and AML-MRC who were treated with AZA between May 2011 and June 2019 in our hospital. Plasma fibrinogen and serum albumin levels were measured before the start of AZA treatment. A total of 99 patients were included in the analysis. The optimal cut-off value of FARI for predicting the 1-year overall survival (OS) was determined by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be 0.079. A total of 59 (60%) and 40 (40%) patients had an FARI >=0.079 (high-FARI group) and < 0.079 (low-FARI group), respectively. The high-FARI patients had a significantly shorter OS than low-FARI patients (1-year OS, 35.6% vs. 77.5%, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, parameters with independent adverse significance for the OS were a high FARI (>=0.079) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-4.29; p = 0.006), and Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) very high (HR 1.483, 95% CI, 1.12-1.963, p = 0.006). A high FARI was found to be associated with a poor outcome in MDS and AML-MRC patients treated with AZA, and FARI was an independent prognostic factor for the OS in these patients. Further internal and external validations are needed to clarify the prognostic role of the FARI for MDS and AML-MRC patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","953-957","","4","100","","Ann.

Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of WBC at diagnosis considering the minimal residual disease (MRD) status at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We evaluated adult patients with Ph+ ALL who achieved negative-MRD and received HCT in first complete remission between 2006 and 2018. The entire cohort was temporally divided into derivation (n = 258) and validation cohorts (n = 366). Using a threshold of 15,000/muL, which was determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the derivation cohort, high WBC was associated with an increased risk of hematological relapse in both the derivation cohort (25.3% vs. 11.6% at 7 years, P = 0.004) and the validation cohort (16.2% vs. 8.5% at 3 years, P = 0.025). In multivariate analyses, high WBC was a strong predictor of hematological relapse in the derivation cohort (HR, 2.52, 95%CI 1.32-4.80, P = 0.005) and in the validation cohort (HR, 2.32, 95%CI, 1.18-4.55; P = 0.015).

Measurable residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy could be incorporated as a useful parameter for treatment decisions. The present study evaluated treatment outcomes according to the next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD status and the type of consolidation therapy in patients with normal karyotype (NK)-AML. By sequencing 278 paired samples collected at diagnosis and first remission (CR1), we identified 361 mutations in 124 patients at diagnosis and tracked these at CR1. After excluding mutations associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis, 82 mutations in 50 of the 124 patients (40.3%) were detected at CR1. Survival benefit was observed in favor of allogeneic HCT over chemotherapy consolidation in the MRDpos subgroup with respect to overall survival (HR 0.294, p = 0.003), relapse-free survival (HR 0.376, p = 0.015) and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR 0.279, p = 0.004) in multivariate analysis, but not in the MRDneg subgroup.

Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a marker of regulatory T cells, functions as a transcription factor involved in immune cell regulation, and its expression correlates with prognosis in many malignancies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the relative gene expression level of FOXP3 in childhood B-ALL and to detect its prognostic utility. Method(s): The study included 139 bone marrow samples obtained from 112 patients at diagnosis and 27 healthy children. Following extraction, RNA was reverse transcribed and the relative expression level of FOXP3 was quantified by quantitative PCR. Cytogenetics, immunophenotype, and minimal residual disease were analyzed according to international guidelines. Result(s): A highly significant overexpression of FOXP3 was detected in childhood B-ALL patients at diagnosis, which was associated with a stronger risk for disease relapse and patients' worse survival. Moreover, multivariate regression models highlighted the independent prognostic value of FOXP3 for childhood B-ALL. Finally, the combination of FOXP3 relative expression with clinically used disease markers clearly enhanced the prediction of treatment stratification. Conclusion(s): High FOXP3 relative expression was associated with inferior outcome suggesting its potentiality as a molecular prognostic marker to predict childhood B-ALL patients' outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","e29129","","10","68","","Pediatr.

Furthermore, modern targeted therapies have recently been incorporated into ALL management; rituximab for CD20-positive and blinatumomab for measurable residual disease after induction therapy or relapsed or refractory disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is recommended as consolidation therapy for high-risk ALL; however, its relative benefit for these high-risk groups and after novel therapies is unclear. We performed an analysis of posttransplantation outcomes in a cohort of 261 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL at the 3-site Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (January 1, 2008-December 31, 2018). With a median (range) follow-up of 22.4 months (0.5-135.0), the 100-day and 5-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality rates were 6.5% and 26.7%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and death were 22.6% and 46.2%, respectively. The 1-year estimate of the composite endpoint of graft-versus-host disease/relapse-free survival was 39.3%. We observed no associations of novel high-risk groups or modern targeted therapies with overall survival, nonrelapse mortality, or relapse in multivariable analysis. An increased risk of relapse was observed with T-ALL (hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.09; P = .02) and hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (hazard ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-7.62; P = .04). Our analysis suggests that novel high-risk groups derive a similar benefit from allo-HCT as traditional high-risk adult ALL and that novel targeted therapies do not seem to independently predict for posttransplantation outcomes. It also calls for further exploration of maintenance strategies after Allo-HCT to prevent relapse in high-risk subgroups.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","2021","2022-09-06 19:01:43","2022-09-06 19:01:43","","165.e1-165.e11","","2","27","","Transplant.
